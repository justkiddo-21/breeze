/**
 * Web/API mirror of the agent's STRICT-level script security patterns
 * (`agent/internal/executor/security.go`, `strictPatterns`).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (#5129)
 *
 * The agent refuses to execute a script whose content matches one of its
 * danger patterns. Basic-level patterns (`rm -rf /`, `Format-Volume`, fork
 * bombs, block-device writes) are unconditional and stay that way — there is
 * no legitimate RMM use for them and nothing here can override them.
 *
 * Strict-level patterns are different: `reg add HKLM` is one of the most common
 * things an MSP tech does on Windows, and before #5129 it was blocked at the
 * agent with no override anywhere in the product. Those patterns are now
 * *acknowledgeable per script*: an admin who can already manage scripts is
 * shown which patterns the script content matches, acknowledges the ones they
 * intend, and the acknowledged descriptions ride the dispatch payload. The
 * agent allows exactly the Strict patterns whose description was acknowledged
 * and still blocks every other match.
 *
 * The acknowledgement is stored as the SET OF MATCHED DESCRIPTIONS, never a
 * bare boolean. A boolean would mean acknowledging an HKLM write permanently
 * disarms Strict checking for that script, so a later edit that introduces a
 * credential-dumping pattern would inherit the approval silently. With the
 * description set, the existing approval stands and the newly-introduced
 * pattern is unacknowledged and still blocks.
 *
 * CONTRACT WITH THE GO VALIDATOR
 *
 * The `description` strings below are protocol values, not display copy: they
 * are stored, sent on the wire, and compared byte-for-byte against the agent's
 * own descriptions. They are deliberately NOT translated — a translated
 * acknowledgement would never match. `scriptSecurityPatterns.test.ts` parses
 * `agent/internal/executor/security.go` and fails if the two lists drift in
 * either pattern source or description.
 *
 * Any residual regex-engine divergence between RE2 and JS is fail-SAFE in both
 * directions: a pattern this file misses cannot be acknowledged, so the agent
 * still blocks it; a pattern only this file matches lets an admin acknowledge
 * something harmless. Neither direction can loosen the agent.
