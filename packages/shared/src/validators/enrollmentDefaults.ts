 * The option list a TTL picker should actually render.

 *
 *  - A settings editor may hold a stored value above the cap. That value is
 *    legitimate — `defaultEnrollmentTtlMinutes` is lock-exempt, and
 *    `resolveEnrollmentDefaults` clamps it at READ time, which is where
 *    clamping belongs. Rewriting it on save would destroy the operator's
 *    original intent (and silently, since these editors rebuild the whole
 *    defaults blob on any save).
 *  - An API-set default may be a non-canonical minute count under the cap
 *    (e.g. 20000). Filtering it out would leave the `<select>` matching no
 *    option, so the browser would display the FIRST option while the state —
 *    and therefore the request — still carried 20000. That display/submit
 *    divergence is the same class of defect this feature exists to remove.
 *
 * So: offerable options, plus `currentValue` when it is set and not already
 * among them, ascending. Callers must be able to label a non-canonical value —
 * check `ENROLLMENT_TTL_I18N_KEYS[minutes]` and fall back to a minutes string.
 *
 * Note this can legitimately return a value ABOVE `maxTtlMinutes` (the stored
 * over-cap case). That is correct for the settings editors, which describe
 * stored intent. A picker that MINTS something — the Add Device modal — must
 * additionally run its value through `clampTtlToOfferableOption` first, so it
 * never offers a lifetime the mint routes will reject with a 400.
