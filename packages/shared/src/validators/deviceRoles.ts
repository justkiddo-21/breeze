/**
 * Device-role SSOT (#3205 moved it here from the validators barrel).
 *
 * Lives in its own module so sibling validators (contracts.ts) can import it
 * directly. The barrel re-exports contracts.ts BEFORE the line where these
 * tuples used to be declared, so importing them back through index.ts during
 * schema construction was an initialization cycle waiting to happen.
 *
 * Adding a role here means also widening `contract_lines_device_roles_chk`
 * (migration 2026-10-05-100100, test-enforced) and the hand-maintained web
 * mirror in apps/web/src/lib/deviceRoles.ts. The AI description derives from
 * this tuple automatically.
