description: Use when implementing a fix for a known GitHub issue end-to-end on the Breeze repo — "work on issue #N", "take issue #N to a PR", "fix #N and open a PR", or dispatching an issue-fixer agent. Covers claiming, isolated worktree, the fix, verification, PR, /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr, and the ready-for-review comment. NOT for triaging which issue to do (that's gh-queue).

# Issue → PR

## Overview

Execution runbook that carries **one already-chosen GitHub issue** from claim to
a reviewed, open PR. Triage already happened (see `gh-queue`); this skill runs
*after* the decision to work an issue is made.

Repo: `LanternOps/breeze`. Two hard boundaries: **the worker never merges** and
**the worker never closes the issue** — those stay the user's call.

## When to use vs. not

- **Use:** "fix #1234", "take #1234 to a PR", an `issue-fixer` agent picking up a number.
- **Don't use for triage** ("what's waiting on me", "any new issues") → that's `gh-queue`.
- **Don't redefine etiquette** — comment style, never-self-close, and lifecycle
  live in the `github-issues` skill. Follow it; don't restate it.

## The lifecycle

```dot
digraph issue_to_pr {
  "Read full issue + comments" [shape=box];
  "Eligible?" [shape=diamond];
  "ABORT — report back" [shape=box];
  "Assign to self" [shape=box];
  "Worktree off fresh main" [shape=box];
  "Fix (debug/brainstorm)" [shape=box];
  "Verify: tests + typecheck" [shape=box];
  "Commit / push / PR (Closes #N)" [shape=box];
  "/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr" [shape=box];
  "Findings?" [shape=diamond];
  "Comment: what the review ran" [shape=box];
  "STOP — hand off (no merge, no close)" [shape=doublecircle];

  "Read full issue + comments" -> "Eligible?";
  "Eligible?" -> "ABORT — report back" [label="no"];
  "Eligible?" -> "Assign to self" [label="yes"];
  "Assign to self" -> "Worktree off fresh main";
  "Worktree off fresh main" -> "Fix (debug/brainstorm)";
  "Fix (debug/brainstorm)" -> "Verify: tests + typecheck";
  "Verify: tests + typecheck" -> "Commit / push / PR (Closes #N)";
  "Commit / push / PR (Closes #N)" -> "/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr";
  "/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr" -> "Findings?";
  "Findings?" -> "Fix (debug/brainstorm)" [label="yes, address"];
  "Findings?" -> "Comment: what the review ran" [label="clean"];
  "Comment: what the review ran" -> "STOP — hand off (no merge, no close)";
}
```

## 0. Select an issue (when you weren't handed a number)

If invoked with a specific issue number, skip to step 1. If asked to "find
something to work on" / "grab an issue off the backlog", select one yourself:

```bash
# Open issues with the signals needed to rank them.
gh issue list --repo LanternOps/breeze --state open --limit 60 \
  --json number,title,assignees,labels,createdAt,comments
```

Rank candidates, best first. **Prefer** an issue that is:

- **Unassigned** (or assigned to you — see the note on "you" in step 1).
- **Actionable without design** — a clear repro, root cause, or file pointers in
  the body/comments. A precise root-cause comment from a maintainer is gold.
- **Bounded** — one component, a contained fix.

**Skip** (don't even open a worktree):

- Anything labeled `tracking`/epic/meta, `needs-design`/`question`/`discussion`/`RFC`.
- Infra firefighting (`ci-red`, broad "X is broken on main") unless explicitly asked.
- Anything that needs a product/pricing/policy decision.

Then run the **step 1 guard on your top candidate** — that's the real gate
(it catches already-shipped fixes and in-flight PRs that ranking can't see). If
the top candidate aborts on the guard, move to the next candidate; repeat until
one passes or the list is exhausted. **Report which issues you considered and
why you skipped each** — don't silently pick one and hide the rest.

When selecting **several** to fan out, cap the count and state the cap.

## 1. Read & guard (do this before touching anything)

```bash
gh issue view N --repo LanternOps/breeze --comments \
  --json number,title,body,state,assignees,labels,comments
# PRs that reference it — ANY state, not just open (a merged/closed PR may have
# already shipped the fix; --state open would never show it).
gh pr list --repo LanternOps/breeze --state all --search "N in:body" \
  --json number,title,state,headRefName,mergedAt
```

Read the **whole** issue and **every** comment. **ABORT and report back** (do
not start work) if any of these is true:

- Issue is **closed**.
- Already **assigned to someone else** (not you, not unassigned). **"You" is the
  operator's GitHub account** — the `@me` login, resolved with
  `gh api user --jq .login` — **not a separate agent identity.** An issue
  assigned to that account is "assigned to you" and is **eligible** (work it);
  only an issue assigned to a *different* login is "someone else" → abort. If
  you're a subagent, you have no GitHub identity of your own, so never read the
  operator's own assigned issues as belonging to a third party.
- **A PR already references it.** An **open** PR → work is in flight, don't
  duplicate. A **merged/closed** PR (or a member comment / commit on `main`
  saying "fixed in #NNN" / "merged to main") → **the fix likely already
  shipped** and the issue is open only awaiting reporter confirmation. Verify
  against `origin/main` before concluding either way — a `gh pr list --state open`
  miss does NOT mean no fix exists. Don't open a duplicate no-op PR.
- It's **too ambiguous or too large** to fix without design — needs a spec or a
  product decision first. Say so; don't guess a fix.

Aborting is a success, not a failure. Report *why* so the orchestrator/user can
decide. Guessing past a guard wastes a worktree and a review cycle.

## 2. Claim

```bash
gh issue edit N --repo LanternOps/breeze --add-assignee @me
```

## 3. Isolated worktree

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`. The main working
copy at `/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze` is shared across sessions and drifts —
**verify your base is fresh `main`** before branching (a stale base has nearly
shipped dozens of unrelated commits in a PR).

**Spawn-location trap (read this):** When an orchestrator fans you out, your
CWD is very likely **already inside an existing worktree under
`.claude/worktrees/` that belongs to a *different* task**. That is NOT your
workspace. Do **not** edit there, and do **not** reach back into the shared
`/Users/toddhebebrand/breeze` checkout (it may be on a stale branch). Always
`git fetch origin main`, then create your **own** new worktree off
`origin/main`, `cd` into it, and confirm `git rev-parse HEAD` equals
`origin/main` before you branch. Editing the spawn worktree or the shared
checkout has silently reverted other in-flight PRs' files.

Branch naming (AGENTS.md — no `codex/` / `claude/` prefixes):
`fix/N-short-slug`, `feat/N-short-slug`, `docs/short-slug`, `chore/short-slug`.

Fresh worktrees need `pnpm install` and the gitignored `.env.test` symlink —
without it RLS forge tests pass vacuously on a BYPASSRLS connection. Prefix
node-pinned commands: `PATH=$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin:$PATH`.

## 4. Fix

- Bug → **REQUIRED:** `superpowers:systematic-debugging` (find root cause before patching).
- Feature/behavior change → `superpowers:brainstorming` first if the issue left design open.
- Touching tenant tables / migrations → follow the RLS shapes + migration rules
  in `CLAUDE.md` (policies in the same migration, idempotent, never edit a
  shipped migration). Touching the Go agent → write to `agent/`, not `apps/agent/`.

## 5. Verify (evidence before "done")

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `breeze-testing` for what to cover.

- Run the **affected** test files single-fork (the full API suite is flaky in
  parallel — don't trust or trigger a full red run): `pnpm exec vitest run <path>`.
- Type-check touched areas: `npx tsc --noEmit` (and `astro check` if `.astro`
  changed — plain tsc skips Astro files).
- Go changes: `cd agent && go test -race ./internal/<pkg>/...`.

Do not proceed to the ready comment on red tests. **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:**
`superpowers:verification-before-completion`.

## 6. Commit / push / PR

Use `commit-commands:commit-push-pr` (or do it by hand). The PR body must
include `Closes #N`. PR title follows `fix(scope): summary (#N)` /
`feat(scope): summary (#N)`. Required trailers:

- Commit messages end with: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- PR body ends with the `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]…` line.

## 7. Review

Run `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` on the PR. Address every real finding (loop
back to step 4 → re-verify). Re-run review if you made non-trivial changes.

## 8. Ready signal — comment reports *what the last review ran*

Assignee stays **you**. Post a comment **on the PR** (not the issue) in the
bold-section style (`github-issues` / comment-style conventions). The comment's
job is to record **what the last review run was and its outcome** — NOT a
generic "ready for review" banner.

```markdown
**Review run:** /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr (code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, pr-test-analyzer)
**Findings:** 2 raised → both addressed in <sha>; 0 outstanding.
**Tests:** apps/api affected suite green (`vitest run routes/foo.test.ts`, 14 passed); `tsc --noEmit` clean.
**Status:** review-clean, awaiting maintainer merge.
```

If review surfaced nothing, say that explicitly ("0 findings") rather than
omitting the line — a missing line reads as "didn't run it."

## 9. Hand off — STOP

Report the PR number + a one-line summary to the orchestrator/user. Then stop.

**The worker does NOT merge and does NOT close the issue.** Merge (a bare `gh pr merge <N>`
into the merge queue, gated on green required checks; never `--admin`) and closure (after the reporter/user verifies)
are the user's judgment calls — see the merge/hold rules. The issue stays
**open and assigned to you** until then.

## Red flags — STOP if you catch yourself

- "It's obviously fixed, I'll just close the issue." → **Never.** Hand off open.
- "Checks are green, I'll merge it." → **Never.** Merge is the user's call.
- "The issue's a bit vague but I'll guess what they meant." → **Abort & ask** (step 1).
- "Someone's assigned but they seem stalled, I'll take it." → **Abort & report** — don't poach. (But an issue assigned to the operator's own `@me` account is *not* poaching — work it; see step 1.)
- "No *open* PR, so nobody's fixed it." → Check **merged/closed** PRs + commits on `main` too. Open-only is a blind spot.
- "I'll skip the worktree, the main copy is fine." → No. Stale base + shared copy = wrong-commit PR.
- "I'm already inside a worktree, I'll just use this one." → No — it's another task's worktree. Make your *own* off fresh `origin/main`.
- "Affected tests pass, skip the rest / skip typecheck." → Run typecheck (and astro check) too.
- "Posting 'ready for review' is enough." → No. Record *which review ran and what it found*.

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "A commit means it's done, close it." | A commit isn't verification. Reporter/user closes. |
| "Green CI means I can merge." | Merge is gated on the user's hold/judgment rules, not just CI. |
| "Aborting wastes the dispatch." | Aborting on a guard is the correct, cheap outcome. Guessing is expensive. |
| "Full suite is red so my change is broken." | The full API suite is flaky in parallel — verify via affected files single-fork. |

## Orchestrating multiple issues

To work several issues at once, the in-session agent acts as orchestrator:

1. **Decide the issue numbers BEFORE dispatch — never let multiple workers
   self-select in parallel.** Each worker's step-0 selection ranks the backlog
   the same way and claims aren't visible at selection time, so parallel
   self-selecting agents converge on the *same* top issue and open duplicate PRs
   (observed: 3 agents → PRs #1917/#1918/#1919, all on #1896). Get a distinct set
   one of two ways:
   - The user **named explicit numbers / a label filter** → use that list.
   - The user asked you to **"find a few" with no numbers** → *you* (the
     orchestrator) do the selection: scan the backlog once, rank with the step-0
     criteria, pick **N distinct** eligible candidates, run the step-1 guard on
     each, and **claim each up front** (`gh issue edit <N> --add-assignee @me`)
     so the set is reserved. Only then dispatch.

   Any orchestrator-level eligibility pre-check has the same blind spot as the
   worker's: `gh pr list --state open` won't reveal an already-merged fix, so
   don't pre-declare an issue "eligible" on that basis — the worker's full guard
   (comments + `--state all` + `origin/main`) is the real gate.
2. **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` — spawn one
   `issue-fixer` agent **per already-chosen number**, each in its **own worktree**
   (isolation prevents branch/DB collisions; see the worktree skill). Every agent
   gets a concrete number — none self-selects.
3. Each agent runs this runbook independently and returns its PR number (or its
   abort reason). A worker that finds its handed number already assigned to `@me`
   (because the orchestrator pre-claimed it) treats that as eligible — that's the
   reservation working, not a poach.
4. Collect the results into one summary table for the user. The orchestrator
   does **not** merge or close either — same boundary applies.

Do not auto-expand the list beyond what the user named. If you self-selected
from a label, `log`/state the cap and which issues were dropped.

> **Anti-pattern (do not do this):** dispatching 2+ `issue-fixer` agents that
> each run step-0 selection, trusting a "skip already-claimed issues" instruction
> to keep them apart. Selection precedes any visible claim, so the guard can't
> see a sibling's pick — they collide. Distinctness is the orchestrator's job,
> settled before dispatch.
