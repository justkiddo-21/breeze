// A proven-failed dismissal and a dead helper both deliver an outcome here, and

// IMPORTANT: "at most one". The outcome is produced when a correlated response
// arrives or the session tears down, so a helper that hangs while its session
// stays CONNECTED — precisely what raises the ErrCommandTimeout that creates
// this error — may never produce one at all. Readers MUST bound the receive
// (and must not assume a nil channel is impossible); blocking on it forever is
// how the fail-closed gate turns into a permanent lockout.
