// SQL Server Express Edition does not support backup compression at all:
// BACKUP ... WITH COMPRESSION fails there with "Msg 1844 ... BACKUP
// DATABASE WITH COMPRESSION is not supported on Express Edition." (D23,

// checking SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') up front, but SERVERPROPERTY output
// isn't the only signal worth trusting — so regardless of what the edition
// check says, a Msg 1844 response always triggers exactly one retry
// without COMPRESSION.

// an Express edition (including "Express Edition with Advanced Services").
