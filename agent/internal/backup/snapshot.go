//     the matched set before the loop starts, so the very first progress
//     emission reflects the resume instead of a slow trickle of
//     skip-iterations.
//   - Every freshly uploaded file is appended to the journal as it lands.
//   - On a full success (manifest uploaded), the journal is completed
//     (closed + removed) — the checkpoint is no longer needed. On every
//     other exit — stopped, per-file exhaustion, manifest failure — the

// buildPreviousIndex). A decideReference file skips upload AND journal
// Record entirely — it still counts toward filesDone/bytesDone through the
// same locked markDone path used everywhere else (keepalive/progress just
// work, same instant-jump semantics as a journal resume). nil means "no
// usable previous manifest" — every file uploads, identical to this
// function's behavior before incremental backups existed.
//
// Priority when a file matches BOTH the journal's resumedFiles set and the
// reference index: the journal wins. The journal represents an object THIS
// run itself already uploaded (during an earlier, interrupted attempt at
// the very same snapshot ID) and is authoritative for it; the reference
// index only offers to point at an OLDER snapshot's object. Checking
// resumedFiles first in the loop below implements that priority.
//
// sourceLiveness, if non-nil, reports whether the point-in-time source the
// files were read from still exists (the VSS shadow copy — see
// newShadowRootLiveness). It is consulted only after a per-file upload has
// already failed, and a positive answer aborts the whole run rather than
// letting every remaining file be recorded as individually bad (#3260). nil
// means the run reads the live filesystem and has nothing to defend.
//
// runIdentity, if provided (variadic so the ~25 existing call sites that
// don't care about it need no change — same pattern as main.go's
// `tickets ...*backupExecutionTicket`), is stamped onto the new snapshot's
// BackupIdentity (see that field's doc comment and runBackupIdentity) so a
