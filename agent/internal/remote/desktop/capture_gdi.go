// (ci.yml, inherited red tracked in #2523). A test placed beside the capturer
// would therefore execute on no platform at all and pass vacuously.

// compiles and is exercised on the Linux runner, while capture_windows_nocgo.go

// gdiCallError turns a failed GDI call into an error that carries the Win32

//
// Why this exists (#5284): every GDI call on the capture path used the
// `ret, _, _ :=` form, discarding the errno. The Winlogon-desktop failure that
// took remote desktop to 0 FPS at the logged-out console was therefore reported
// to the technician as the bare string "GetDIBits failed" — no code, nothing to
// look up, and no way to tell an access denial from an invalid parameter. This
// path cannot be reproduced off a live secure desktop, so the error text IS the
// diagnostic channel.
//
// The message reports what was OBSERVED and names no single cause, per the
// convention capture_errors.go establishes.
//
// A zero errno is reported distinctly rather than as "error 0". Not every GDI
// entry point sets extended error information on failure — BitBlt documents
// that it does, GetDIBits does not guarantee it — so "the call failed and Win32
// recorded no reason" is a real observation, distinct from "failed with code N",
// and rendering it as code 0 would send the reader to look up ERROR_SUCCESS.
//
// The zero is trustworthy rather than stale: Go's Windows syscall trampoline
// clears the thread's last-error before the native call and reads it back
// afterwards, so an explicit SetLastError(0) here would be redundant.

// on a DIFFERENT goroutine that pins and attaches ITS OWN thread
// (prepareCaptureThread, called from captureLoop) — so every frame after the
// probe used a display DC and bitmap created against a thread, and a desktop
// attachment, that no longer exist. Rebuilding when the owning thread changes
