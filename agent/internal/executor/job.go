// This file carries the PORTABLE half of Windows Job Object containment
// (#3525, spec OD4-B): the primitive interface, the launch sequence and the
// hard-kill. It deliberately has no build tag so the call-order contract test
// (job_contract_test.go) runs in the Linux `test-agent` job too — the Windows
// CI job is a much thinner safety net (`internal/heartbeat` is on its known-red
// exclusion list, #2523, which is why this lives in internal/executor).
//
// The native syscalls live in job_windows.go; on every other platform the
// primitives are never constructed and containment is the process group
// instead (tree_kill_unix.go).

// jobObjectLimitKillOnJobClose is JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE. With it
// set, closing the last handle to the job terminates every process still in it,
// so an agent crash cannot strand a script's children.
