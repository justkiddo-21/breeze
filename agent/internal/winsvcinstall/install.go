// Package winsvcinstall owns the Service Control Manager half of
// `service install` for the Windows agent and the Windows watchdog.
//
// It exists because of #5299. Both installers used to call CreateService
// unconditionally, which fails outright on a host where the service already
// exists, and neither ever issued a start: the service was created
// StartAutomatic, which starts it at the next BOOT, and the command then
// printed a message claiming the agent was "installed and running". On an
// already-enrolled remote host that is the same stranding bug #5252 fixed for
// Linux and macOS — the device goes Offline and stays Offline until somebody
// reaches the box out of band.
//
// The interfaces below are deliberately expressed in neutral terms with no
// golang.org/x/sys/windows types, so the whole decision sequence — sample
// before stopping, stop before staging the binary, create-or-reconfigure,
// start, confirm RUNNING — compiles and its tests execute on every platform.
// That matters concretely: `internal/agentapp` is NOT in the Test Agent
// (Windows) package list (its inherited Windows reds are tracked in #2523), so
// a //go:build windows test placed next to the installer would have run on no
// CI job at all. Only the thin *_windows.go adapter in this package is
// platform-bound, and `build-agent (windows/amd64)` compiles it.
