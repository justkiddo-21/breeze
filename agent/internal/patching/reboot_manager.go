// RebootManager: scheduling, user notification, circuit breaking and execution
// of a deferred reboot.
//
// Intentionally untagged. Before #3197 the whole manager lived in
// reboot_windows.go behind //go:build windows, with reboot_other.go providing a
// no-op stub for every other platform. Two consequences, both fixed here:
//
//   - Nothing about it was testable. ./internal/patching is not in the
//     test-agent-windows package allowlist, so a windows-tagged test would run
//     nowhere in CI (issues #3019, #3046). Now the manager, its notification
//     timers and its circuit breaker all compile and test on linux.
//   - Linux and macOS silently never rebooted. patchJobExecutor dispatches
//     schedule_reboot with no OS check, the stub's Schedule() returned nil
//     without doing anything, and the patch job recorded a clean result. A
//     "patch reboots now warn the user" fix that is Windows-only would have
//     left that in place.
//
// Only the OS invocation is platform-specific now; see reboot_os_*.go.
