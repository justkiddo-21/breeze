// The Linux vehicle for the reboot warning ladder (issue #3207, wave 4).
//
// Windows and macOS deliver the prompt through the desktop helper over the
// session-broker IPC. No helper binary ships for Linux — release.yml builds it
// for darwin only — so on Linux the broker has no session to talk to and every
// interactive rung was silently swallowed. The daemon therefore draws the
// dialog itself, dropping to the signed-in user to do it.
//
// This file is UNTAGGED and holds every decision: what argv zenity and
// notify-send are handed, what each exit code means, and how a fan-out across
// several signed-in users resolves to one answer. Only the exec — which needs
// syscall.Credential — is behind //go:build linux, in
// reboot_prompt_desktop_linux.go. The package is not in the
// test-agent-windows allowlist (#3019, #3046), so anything a build tag hides
// here is tested nowhere; that is why the split falls where it does.
