// Deferral arithmetic and its on-disk ledger (issue #3207).
//
// Untagged on purpose, for the same reason reboot_plan.go is: ./internal/patching
// is not in the test-agent-windows package allowlist (#3019, #3046), so anything
// behind a build tag is tested nowhere in CI.
//
// The COUNTER is a UX affordance; the DEADLINE is the guarantee. A deferral is
// always clamped to the deadline the API sent, and refused outright when the
// clamp leaves less room than MinRebootDelay. That is what finally gives
// RebootState.Deadline a job (#3253: stored and reported, never enforced).
