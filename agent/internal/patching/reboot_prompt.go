// The prompt half of the reboot warning ladder (issue #3207).

// dialogs themselves are windows/darwin-only and therefore tested nowhere in CI
// (#3019, #3046), so every decision ABOUT the dialog — which rungs may offer a
// button, how long it may stay on screen, what the buttons say — lives here as
// pure data.
