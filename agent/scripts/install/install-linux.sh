# (Re)install the watchdog systemd unit on EVERY install/upgrade.
#
# `breeze-watchdog service install` always rewrites the unit file (and runs
# daemon-reload + enable). Re-running it on an existing host is how unit changes
# — e.g. the RuntimeDirectory=breeze / RuntimeDirectoryPreserve=yes additions
# for #1297 — reach already-deployed watchdogs. The old "rewrite only when
# absent, else just restart" path silently skipped those edits, so an upgraded
# host kept its stale watchdog unit and stayed one reboot away from a
# 226/NAMESPACE wedge. `service install` is idempotent, so always calling it is
# safe. Since #5252 `service install` restarts the unit itself, but this script
# also runs against hosts where no NEW watchdog binary was staged above — in
# which case the OLD binary's install still only enables — so the explicit
# restart stays as the belt-and-braces path.
#
# The call is GUARDED. Since #5252 `breeze-watchdog service install` exits
# non-zero when it cannot restart the watchdog, and this script runs under
# `set -e` — so a bare call would abort the installer here, long before the
# breeze-agent restart at the bottom, and leave the agent stopped. That is the
# very stranding this script is being changed to prevent, just reached through
# the watchdog leg. A watchdog problem must never block the agent.
