   * Restores an archived org. This page's OWN list state is updated

   * and re-select it so the detail pane switches out of read-only
   * immediately. Deliberately not a `refreshOrgs()` (which also re-fetches
   * this page's OWN list): that would re-fetch the plain list and could race
   * this optimistic update, and everything the active list needs
   * (id/name/status/deviceCount/createdAt) already rode along on the archived
   * row itself.
   *
   * The global org store (`orgStore.ts`, feeds the org-switcher/sidebar) is a
   * SEPARATE concern from this page's own state and doesn't share that
   * optimistic update — it has to hear about the restored org from the server
   * to pick up fields this page never had (partnerId, currencyCode, trial
   * end date). Fired fire-and-forget, same as `refreshOrgs` does for org
   * create: it must not block clearing `restoringOrgId` or block/replace the
   * success toast, and a failure here is a stale switcher entry, not a
   * failed restore — the restore itself already committed.

      //      left an ordinary dropped connection showing an order the server
      //      never accepted, with only a transient toast and no correction.
      //   2. Restoring a locally captured pre-drag array fixes that but CANNOT
      //      be correct: `runAction` collapses every request-side throw to
      //      status 0, so a PATCH that COMMITTED and then lost its response is
      //      indistinguishable from one that never arrived. Restoring locally
      //      would then show an order the server does not have — the same
      //      lie, in the other direction. It also races an in-flight
      //      authoritative GET and can clobber newer data with an older
      //      snapshot.
      //
      // Only the server knows what actually persisted, so the closest thing to
      // a correct answer is to ask it. Two limits, stated rather than implied:
      //
      //   - A slow GET could install an order that a later reorder already
      //     superseded. That needs a SECOND drag to overlap the first request,
      //     which `reorderPending` now prevents by disabling dragging until
      //     this settles. A client generation counter was tried first and
      //     reverted: it discarded genuinely current create/delete/import
      //     refreshes — leaving a newly created org invisible — while still
      //     not covering a GET resolving during an in-flight PATCH.
      //     Serializing the drags removes the overlap those guards were
      //     chasing. Two reorders from SEPARATE TABS can still interleave;
      //     that one needs a revision or compare-and-swap on the endpoint,
      //     which has neither.
      //   - Reconciliation used to be authoritative only up to the FIRST page:
      //     the list endpoint paged by `created_at, id` and applied the
      //     partner's preferred order only WITHIN each page, so a drag that
      //     crossed a page boundary could not survive the refetch. Fixed
      //     server-side in #4004 — the preferred order is now the leading
      //     ORDER BY term of the paginated query, so the page walk returns the
      //     stored order end to end and this GET is authoritative for the whole
      //     list.
      //
      // The refetch was previously unsafe purely because fetchOrganizations
      // answered its own 401 with a bare navigateTo('/login'), which raced the
