// The problem (#3704): settling the gate releases every refresh queued behind
// it, and a dead-cookie refresh's 401 evicts via handleSessionExpired, whose
// `window.location.replace(…&reason=session-expired)` is a HARD navigation —
// it aborts an in-flight soft one and overwrites the URL. The user then reads
// "Your session expired", which points away from SSO and invites an infinite
// retry loop, since signing in again just re-runs the same broken SSO round
// trip. `navigateTo` is an async page transition, so issuing it un-awaited and
// settling on the next line handed that race to the eviction every time.
//
// TWO mechanisms close it, because neither is sufficient alone:
//
//  1. Order. Awaiting the navigation means that by the time the gate opens the
//     address bar is already on /login, where handleSessionExpired's own
//     pathname guard makes its redirect a no-op. This holds whenever navigateTo
//     completes a real Astro soft transition — `navigate()` resolves only after
//     `history.replaceState` has moved the URL — which is the live path here,
//     since AuthOverlay only ever renders under layouts that mount
//     <ClientRouter />.
//  2. Precedence. It does NOT hold on navigateTo's own fallback: when the
//     transition throws, it fires `window.location.replace` and returns, having
//     merely QUEUED a hard navigation, so the address bar has not moved yet and
//     the guard in (1) misses. markSsoExchangeFailed() covers that gap by
//     making the eviction redirect to the same URL instead of racing it.
//
// The eviction itself is still correct and still runs — the SSO exchange really
// did fail. Only its generic *reason* was wrong.
//
// `finally`, not a plain sequence: waiting on the navigation must not become a
// new way to deadlock. If it throws, the queued refreshes still have to be
// released rather than hang on the gate's 15s timeout backstop.
