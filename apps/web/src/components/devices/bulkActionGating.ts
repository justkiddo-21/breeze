/**
 * Device-status gating policy shared by every device-action surface — the
 * bulk-action bar (#2465), the DeviceList row menu (#2426) and the grid card
 * (#2488). Owns both the action classification sets and the disabled-state
 * tooltip/hint strings.
 *
 * ## What the API actually rejects (verified, #2465)
 *
 * The obvious gate here — "skip devices that aren't online" — is WRONG, and the
 * mistake has now been made in three places in this codebase. Agent commands are
 * QUEUED, not delivered live:
 *
 *   - `POST /devices/bulk/commands` and `POST /devices/:id/commands` reject
 *     exactly one status: `decommissioned`. There is no online/offline branch.
 *   - `POST /scripts/:id/execute` has no device-status gating at all.
 *   - Commands insert as `status: 'pending'` with NO TTL and are claimed by
 *     `claimPendingCommandsForDevice` on the agent's next poll/heartbeat.
 *
 * So rebooting an OFFLINE device works — it reboots when it comes back. Filtering
 * offline devices out of the batch would DISCARD commands the backend would have
 * honoured: a capability regression, not a bugfix.
 *
 * `"Device is not online"` (#2078) is a real error, but it comes only from
 * LIVE-SESSION endpoints — terminalWs, desktopWs, tunnelWs, tunnels,
 * remote/sessions, bootMetrics. The bulk bar offers none of them. That error got
 * generalised from live sessions to queued commands as the gate was copied out of
 * DeviceActions.tsx into the row menu (#2426) and was about to be copied here.
 *
 * Hence: gate on `decommissioned` — the one status the backend truly refuses, and
 * the one the original complaint was actually about ("scripts queued against
 * devices that can never run them", i.e. retired, agent-less machines).
 *
 * ## Why this lives in its own module
 *
 * So the contract test in DeviceList.test.tsx can bind these sets to the action
 * strings the bulk bar ACTUALLY emits. Without that binding the gate has a silent
 * failure mode: add or rename a bulk action and it simply isn't gated, while every
 * existing test stays green — because a gate's only failure mode is doing nothing.

 *
 * `shutdown` / `lock` / `reboot_safe_mode` have no bulk button today, but
 * runBulkAction's switch already routes them through sendBulkCommand, so they are
 * classified up front: wiring a button later must not silently skip the gate.
 *
 * `decommission` (i.e. bulk Remove) is gated here too, but for a DIFFERENT
 * reason than the agent-command actions above — read this before moving it back
 * to INTENTIONALLY_UNGATED_BULK_ACTIONS. `bulkDecommissionDevices` fires one
 * `DELETE /devices/:id` per selected device, and the API rejects that with
 * `400 Device is already decommissioned` for a device whose status is already
 * `decommissioned` — a distinct rejection from the agent-command one, but the
 * same underlying fact (`isCommandQueueable` / `status !== 'decommissioned'`
 * already answers it). Gating skips already-removed devices and proceeds with
 * the rest; it does NOT skip `offline` devices — retiring an offline (dead)
 * machine is still the intended use case, only retiring an ALREADY-retired one
 * is not. Un-gating this reintroduces the doomed-request bug (#3987 fix wave):
 * select several already-removed devices, hit "Remove Selected", and every one
 * of them 400s into a "Bulk Remove Failed" toast instead of being skipped.

/**
 * Bulk actions deliberately NOT gated on device status. Every one is a considered

 *
 *   wake            — NOT gated here, on two separate grounds. Keep them apart:
 *                     (a) it must never be gated on `online` — it exists precisely
 *                         to reach a device that is NOT running. That's the trap a
 *                         "gate everything" sweep falls into; pinned by test.
 *                     (b) it is not gated on `decommissioned` either — see the NOTE
 *                         below. That one is a deferral, not a principle.
 *   maintenance-*   — a DB flag, not an agent command. (Also see the NOTE.)
 *   deploy-software — navigates to /software; sends no command from here.
 *   link-*          — DB-only topology linkage; no agent involved.
 *   compare         — navigates to /devices/compare; read-only comparison
 *                     view, sends no commands. (It shows stored metrics where
 *                     available and synthetic placeholders otherwise, so a
 *                     decommissioned device is a legitimate — if sometimes
 *                     approximate — comparison subject.)
 *
 * NOTE (follow-up, deliberately out of scope): the API *also* refuses
 * `decommissioned` for bulk wake (`commands.ts:89`) and for maintenance
 * (`commands.ts:382`). So a decommissioned device in either of those batches is
 * still a doomed target today. It degrades gracefully — the API returns a
 * per-device `DECOMMISSIONED` failure and the UI surfaces a partial-failure toast,
 * rather than the silent no-op #2465 was about — so extending the skip treatment to
 * them is a real but separate behaviour change from what #2465 asked for. Flagged in
 * the PR for the maintainer rather than smuggled in here.
