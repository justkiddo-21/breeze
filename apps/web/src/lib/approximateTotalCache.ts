// Module-level cache behind `useApproximateTotal` (lib/useApproximateTotal.ts).
//
// Lives in its own import-free module for the same reason
// `partnerCurrencyCache.ts` does: `stores/auth.ts` resets it from the logout
// path, and the hook imports `fetchWithAuth` FROM that store — importing the
// hook into the store instead would close an import cycle.
//
// Every entry is a converted REPORTING total denominated in the viewer's own
// partner reporting currency (the server derives the target from the actor),
// so it must not survive a partner switch in the same tab. Only a VALIDATED
// server answer is cached; a non-2xx, rejected or malformed response caches
// nothing so the next mount retries. An `unavailable` answer IS a valid answer
// and is cached — re-asking cannot make a missing rate appear.
//
// `generation` binds every request to the reset epoch it started in, so a
// response that lands after a logout can neither commit the previous partner's
// total nor clear the newer in-flight slot (the #3777 review F7 shape).
//
// Invalidation on a partner-currency change used to be LAZY: it only ran
// inside `approximateTotalCacheKey()`, so it fired only on the next render
// that happened to compute a key. An already-mounted `useApproximateTotal`
// line with no other reason to re-render (the normal case: nothing else on
// its props/state changed) never called that function again, so it neither
// noticed the reset nor refetched — the "never refetches" half of #4472.
// `subscribePartnerCurrencyCache` below makes invalidation EAGER: it fires
// the instant `resetPartnerCurrencyCache()` runs, clearing this cache and
// notifying `subscribeApproximateTotalCache` listeners so a mounted hook can
// force its own re-render via `useSyncExternalStore` even with nothing else
// changing.

 * THE key for one cached total — every read and write goes through here.

 * what makes a discarded in-flight response self-heal instead of pinning a
 * stale `failed` status. Without it, a response that lands mid-flight for a
 * generation that has since moved on could still be read back against a
 * same-named key later — the generation guard in `loadApproximateTotal`
 * already refuses to COMMIT such a response, but a mounted line's own effect
 * needs the key itself to change so it re-subscribes to a fresh request
 * rather than resolving into the discarded one silently (#4472). Each entry
 * is denominated in the SERVER-derived partner reporting currency, which the
 * key otherwise could not name (the client never asks for a target; an
 * organization-scoped viewer cannot even read `/orgs/partners/me`), so
 * without the generation prefix an admin who changes the partner reporting
 * currency in the same tab would keep reading — and formatting — figures in
 * the OLD currency until logout.
 *
 * Rather than guess the target, the cache is bound to the partner-currency
 * cache's reset epoch: whatever invalidates THAT (logout, saving partner
 * billing settings) invalidates these totals in the same motion — eagerly,
 * via the `subscribePartnerCurrencyCache` listener above, not just here. This
 * lazy check is kept as a fallback for any caller that reads the cache
 * without having been subscribed (e.g. a render that raced module
 * evaluation); it is idempotent with the eager path.
 *
 * Resolving the partner currency for the first time is not a change and does
 * not bump the generation, so ordinary de-duplication is untouched.
