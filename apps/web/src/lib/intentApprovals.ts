 * caller should settle the card terminally rather than re-offer a button.
 * Throws
 * CeremonyError on a cancelled/failed ceremony (nothing was POSTed) and
 * ActionError on server rejection (runAction has already toasted the latter).
 *
 * The POST opts out of two defaults that would otherwise hide failures: it
 * skips fetchWithAuth's 401 refresh-and-replay (the assertion is single-use, so
 * a replay can only burn it again) and asks runAction to treat the 401 as a
 * real, toastable error — the decide route answers 401 for `assertion_failed`
 * and `reauth_required`, which are proof rejections, not session expiry.
 *
 * Toast copy comes from the shared `i18n` singleton (`./i18n`, a named
 * export) rather than a `useTranslation` hook — this is a non-component lib
 * helper. The `ai:` namespace prefix routes `i18n.t` to the aiApprovalDialog
 * keys added by Task 5 (`decideFailed` / `approvedToast` / `deniedToast`).

/**

 * one at a time means N Touch ID / Windows Hello prompts for what is, to the
 * human, a single decision.
 *
 * Safety rests entirely on the server's homogeneity rule
 * (`services/approvals/batchDecide.ts`): every row must still be pending,
 * fanned out to this user, linked to a SUPERVISED agent-originated intent, and
 * in the same `(orgId, actionToolName, action)` group. The caller must only
 * ever offer a batch the server would accept — the UI grouping predicate
 * mirrors that rule — but the server re-derives it from fresh rows regardless,
 * and answers 422 for the whole set rather than partially deciding one the
 * approver may have misread.
 *
 * Returns per-row outcomes on a 200; the four refusal variants mean NOTHING
 * was decided:
 *   - `needs_device`      — no registered approver device (no POST happened)
 *   - `batch_step_up`     — 403 `step_up_required` OR 401 `reauth_required`:
 *                           the tier ceiling this batch would have to clear is
 *                           above what one ceremony can, so these cards must be
 *                           decided individually (where re-auth is collected
 *                           per decision)
 *   - `batch_not_homogeneous` — 422: the set drifted (a row was decided
 *                           elsewhere, an intent settled); the cards remain
 *                           individually decidable
 *   - `batch_too_large`   — 400: the set exceeds `BATCH_MAX`. The caller
 *                           (`ApprovalsInbox`) mirrors this cap client-side
 *                           (#4460) and refuses before calling in, so this
 *                           only fires on a stale bundle or a drifted group —
 *                           the cards remain individually decidable
 *
 * Deny skips the ceremony (no proof required) and carries the ONE reason the
 * group collected. Throws CeremonyError on a cancelled/failed ceremony (nothing
 * was POSTed) and ActionError on any other server rejection.
