// Async state for the optional "≈ approximate total" line (multi-currency
// spec §8, wave 7 / #3779).
//
// The hook fetches; it does NOT convert. `GET /billing/reporting-totals`
// converts server-side through `convertForReporting` so there is exactly one
// implementation of reporting money math and no converted figure is ever
// computed in the browser (where a document editor could reuse it).
//
// Deliberately NO `usePartnerCurrency` in this chain: that hook reads
// `GET /orgs/partners/me`, which is partner-scope only, so an ORGANIZATION
// scoped viewer — precisely the reader of the most cross-currency data — would
// get a 403 and silently lose the line. The endpoint derives the target
// currency from the actor's partner and returns it as `targetCurrencyCode`.
// There is no client-side default and no 'USD' fallback anywhere here.
//
// Failure is quiet in PRESENTATION, never in existence (#4415): `failed` means
// "the segmentation above is the only figure", and the caller still renders a
// muted sentence saying the approximate total could not be produced. It used to
// mean "render nothing", which is how a self-hoster with no exchange-rate feed
// got a line that simply never appeared. Every non-2xx — including the 409
// NO_REPORTING_CURRENCY a partner can effectively never hit — lands here and
// reads the same to the user.
