/**
 * Scripts list fetcher — walks the offset-paginated `/scripts` endpoint and
 * accumulates every accessible row (#3301).
 *
 * `GET /scripts` defaults to 50 rows and hard-caps `limit` at 100
 * (`apps/api/src/routes/scripts.ts`). Four web call sites requested it with no
 * `limit` and no pagination, so any partner with more than 50 scripts silently
 * saw only the first 50 — no error, no "showing 50 of N", no way to reach the
 * rest. Raising the cap alone would not have fixed that; it would have moved
 * the same silent truncation to 100.
 *
 * Modelled on {@link fetchAllNetworkDevices} in `devicesFetch.ts`, which walks
 * the same offset shape. Kept as its own module rather than folded in there
 * because that file is about the two device arms; sharing only the pagination
 * idiom is not a reason to couple scripts to it.
