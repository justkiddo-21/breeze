-- script_categories.parent_id: make the self-reference erasure-safe (#4873).
--
-- THE DEFECT. `script_categories` is partner-wide-first (epic #2135): `org_id`
-- is NULLABLE, so a category can be org-owned (`org_id` set) or partner-wide
-- (`org_id` NULL, `partner_id` set). GDPR org erasure empties the table with a
-- single `DELETE ... WHERE org_id = $1`, which is only safe for a
-- self-referencing FK when the deleted row set is CLOSED under that reference.
-- A nullable `org_id` breaks the closure: a surviving partner-wide category
-- whose `parent_id` points at an org-owned one raises 23503 and aborts the
-- erasure mid-walk. Found by the FK ON DELETE contract test (#4863 / #4519)
-- and reproduced against Postgres 16.
--
-- THE FIX, in two independent layers:
--
--   1. `ON DELETE SET NULL` on `parent_id` — every referencing column is
--      nullable, so Postgres clears the edge itself and the DELETE can no
--      longer raise, whatever the data looks like. This is what takes the edge
--      off `orgCascadeFkOnDeleteAllowlist.ts`.
--   2. A DEFERRABLE constraint trigger making the offending shape
--      unconstructible in the first place: a child may only name a parent on
--      its own owner axis. Modelled on `configuration_policies_parent_guard`
--      (2026-10-12-100000-config-policy-inheritance.sql, #5080 W01), which
--      closes the identical shape for configuration policies.
--
-- Layer 2 is the whole of the enforcement: `script_categories` has NO create or
-- update route today (the table is schema-only — verified by grepping
-- `scriptCategories` across apps/api/src), so there is no app-layer call site
-- to guard. Putting the rule in the database means the invariant is already
-- enforced whenever those routes are written, rather than depending on whoever
-- writes them remembering it.
--
-- Ownership rule (mirrors the dual-axis shape this table actually has: an
-- org-owned row carries BOTH org_id and its org's partner_id — see the
-- 2026-06-13 backfill — so partner_id alone does not identify the axis;
-- `org_id IS NULL` does):
--   * org-owned child   -> a same-org parent, or a partner-wide parent of that
--                          org's partner;
--   * partner-wide child-> only a partner-wide parent of the same partner;
--   * legacy global row (org_id AND partner_id both NULL, left by the
--     2026-06-13 partner-axis backfill for built-in rows) -> only another
--     global row. Kept legal rather than rejected so an existing built-in
--     hierarchy is not nulled out; it is closed under erasure regardless.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT ADDED: the analogue of `organizations_partner_config_policy_guard`
-- (an AFTER UPDATE OF partner_id trigger on `organizations`). An org changing
-- partner could in principle strand an org-owned category under a partner-wide
-- parent of its OLD partner. Two reasons it is documented rather than guarded:
-- erasure safety no longer depends on the invariant at all (layer 1 handles the
-- cascade whatever the data says), and the compatibility helper below re-derives
-- the parent's partner from `organizations` on every write, so a later partner
-- change cannot make a NEW edge pass a check it should have failed. What it
-- would leave is a stale EXISTING edge, on a table with no write path, at the
-- cost of a per-row trigger on `organizations`. Revisit if script categories
-- ever gain routes.
--
-- Idempotent; no inner BEGIN/COMMIT. Contains DML (the cleanup below), so it
-- elects system scope first.
