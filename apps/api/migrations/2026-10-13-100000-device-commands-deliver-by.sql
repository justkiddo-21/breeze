-- 2026-10-13-100000: deferred delivery for device commands (#5128).
--
-- deliver_by is the DELIVERY deadline: the instant by which an agent must have
-- claimed the row (pending -> sent). It is separate from the execution timeout
-- (services/commandTimeouts.ts), which the stale reaper applies to `sent` rows
-- from executed_at. NULL keeps today's rule for rows created before this
-- migration, so no backfill is needed and old pending rows behave as before
-- (software_install's retired 7-day special case is preserved for such legacy
-- rows inside the reaper, not here).
--
-- submitted_org_id is PROVENANCE, NOT TENANCY. device_commands is intentionally
-- system-scoped (agent WS path, no RLS -- see CLAUDE.md). This column records the
-- device's org at enqueue so claim-time eligibility can cancel rows whose device
-- has since moved org. It is deliberately not named org_id: the RLS-coverage and
-- cascade contract tests auto-discover `org_id` columns, and this table must
-- not be reclassified as tenant-scoped. ON DELETE SET NULL so erasing an org a
-- device has LEFT is never blocked by that device's historical rows.
--
-- DDL only: no DML, so no set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true) is needed
-- (migrationRlsScope.test.ts).
