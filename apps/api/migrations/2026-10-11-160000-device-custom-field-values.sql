-- 2026-10-11-160000-device-custom-field-values.sql   (#3257 W05)
--
-- DEVICE CUSTOM-FIELD VALUES BECOME A REAL TABLE.
--
-- `devices.custom_fields` survives as a TRIGGER-MAINTAINED PROJECTION (Open
-- Decision 1 = A, approved at Gate A), so the ~34 JS readers, the MCP
-- SAFE_DEVICE_RESOURCE_FIELDS projection and BOTH partner-export statement
-- triggers keep working unchanged. Only three SQL consumers are rewritten.
--
-- FOUR THINGS THIS CLOSES, all live defects today:
--   1. The partner export emits TWO records for ONE datum when an org-owned and
--      a partner-wide definition share a field_key, because the identity hash
--      includes f.id (routes/partnerApi/configuration.ts). W03's anti-shadowing
--      trigger forbids NEW ones; this removes the shape entirely by making the
--      ROW the datum, bounded by UNIQUE (device_id, definition_id).
--   2. devices.custom_fields is `excludedOpen` in CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY
--      (every json/jsonb column must be), so every custom-field value was
--      silently DROPPED from the GDPR tenant export. Normalized scalar columns
--      can be `included`.
--   3. custom.<key> filters scanned with jsonb_extract_path_text and no index.
--   4. Deleting a definition orphaned every value stored under it, forever.
--
-- TENANCY: RLS shape 5 (device-id scoped, hot, DENORMALIZED org_id) — a direct
-- breeze_has_org_access(org_id) policy, not an EXISTS join. A direct-org_id
-- policy TRUSTS org_id, so TWO coherence guards sit under it:
--   * a composite FK (device_id, org_id) -> devices(id, org_id), and
--   * a trigger for definition_id, which is DUAL-AXIS (org XOR partner, W02)
--     and therefore not expressible as any single FK.
--
-- WHY THE SCOPE ELEVATION ON A FILE THAT WRITES ROWS *AND* ON THE TRIGGER.
-- devices, organizations and custom_field_definitions are all FORCE ROW LEVEL
-- SECURITY, which binds the table OWNER — the role migrations run as.
-- breeze_current_scope() defaults to 'none', under which breeze_has_org_access
-- and breeze_has_partner_access are both false. Without the elevation the
-- backfill below is a silent 0-row no-op on any connection that does not bypass
-- RLS (the RAISE WARNING prints a truthful-looking `0`), and the coherence
-- trigger cannot see PARTNER-WIDE definitions at all — there is no partner-wide
-- SELECT branch on custom_field_definitions yet (#4944) — so it would reject
-- every legitimate partner-wide value. CI's superuser and hosted prod's
-- BYPASSRLS-carrying `doadmin` both mask this; a self-hosted migration role
-- without BYPASSRLS does not. set_config(..., true) is transaction-local, and
-- autoMigrate's per-file client.begin is that transaction.
--
-- NEVER as a function ATTRIBUTE. `SET "breeze.scope" = 'system'` on the function
-- header is superuser-only for a custom (dotted) GUC, so prod's non-superuser
-- migration role 42501s at CREATE FUNCTION time and the deploy crash-loops (the
-- v0.97.0 EU incident). Both `Check Migrations (non-superuser)` and
-- src/db/migrationGucAttributes.test.ts guard it. The sanctioned form is in-body
-- save/elevate/restore with a SINGLE return path — reference implementation
-- breeze_revalidate_config_policy_feature_references
-- (2026-07-27-a-feature-policy-reference-ownership.sql). `SECURITY DEFINER` and
-- `SET search_path` are kept: search_path is a BUILT-IN GUC, so its attribute
-- form is available to any role.
SELECT set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true);

-- Blindness probe. Prints what the backfill below is actually able to see
-- BEFORE it reports its counts, so a "copied 0 values" line can be trusted. A
-- devices_with_values of 0 on a region known to have custom fields configured,
-- or an effective_scope that is not 'system', means the elevation did not take
-- and every count below is worthless. (W02's lesson: the detection READ is the

-- Coherence: definition_id (and the denormalized field_key) must belong to this

-- purely app-layer, a partner-wide `udf7` belonging to partner B could be
-- attached to a device in partner A's org and the direct-org_id RLS policy
-- would not notice.
--
-- ORDERING (same as W03's): this is a BEFORE ROW trigger, and ExecInsert runs BR
-- triggers AHEAD of both ExecWithCheckOptions and ExecConstraints, so a
-- coherence violation surfaces as P0001 even under a tenant context. A forged
-- cross-tenant org_id still surfaces as 42501 from RLS. Both are asserted
-- separately in deviceCustomFieldValues.integration.test.ts.
--
-- THE MERGE FENCE IS NOT OPTIONAL. An org merge repoints devices.org_id EARLY
-- (the registry walk is parents-first) and breeze_cascade_device_org_id's
-- generic loop restamps this table's org_id in the same statement — while the
-- value's definition is still owned by the LOSER org, because
-- custom_field_definitions' own executor runs LATER in the walk. Without the
-- fence every merge of two orgs that both hold custom-field values aborts with
-- P0001. The fence is narrow on four axes at once — UPDATE only, the row must be
-- moving OUT of the definition's own org, that org must be actively
-- `status='merging'`, and it must be under the SAME partner as the destination
-- (an org merge is same-partner by construction: orgMerge.ts validates it and
-- re-validates in-transaction). An INSERT can therefore never reach the fence,
-- and it can never widen into cross-partner leakage. Convergence is guaranteed
-- within the same transaction: the
-- definitions executor either re-homes the value onto the survivor's
-- identically-keyed definition or repoints the loser's definition to the
-- survivor. Pinned by the org-merge test in the suite above.

-- wave exists to close. After the backfill every pattern-matching stored key has
-- a definition and a row (JSON nulls included, as all-NULL rows), and every write
-- path rejects a key with no visible definition, so nothing else can reach the
-- jsonb behind this table's back.

-- The `IS DISTINCT FROM` guard on the UPDATE is not cosmetic: it is what makes a
-- no-op write take no per-org export lock and emit no WAL.

-- Cross-org device move: re-home values onto the target org's definitions.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. A device moving between two orgs of one MSP carries
-- its values, but an ORG-OWNED definition does not move with it. The moment
-- moveOrg flips devices.org_id, breeze_cascade_device_org_id's generic loop
-- restamps this table's org_id — and the coherence trigger then correctly
-- refuses, because the value still names the SOURCE org's definition. Without
-- this helper, W05 would make every cross-org move of a device carrying
-- org-owned custom-field values fail with a raw P0001.
--
-- The disposition (plan W05 Task 3 Step 4, option (a), recommended and approved
-- there): re-point each value onto the TARGET org's identically-keyed VISIBLE
-- definition; drop values that have no counterpart, reporting the count so the
-- move audit can carry it. Values under PARTNER-WIDE definitions need no action
-- when the move stays inside one partner — the definition remains visible, and
-- the generic loop's org_id restamp is all they need. A cross-PARTNER move
-- (system scope only) loses partner-wide visibility too, and this helper drops
-- those values for the same reason and by the same rule.
--
-- WHY ONE STATEMENT SETS BOTH definition_id AND org_id. Setting definition_id
-- alone would name a target-org definition while org_id still says source, which
-- the coherence trigger refuses. The composite FK is INITIALLY DEFERRED, so
-- pointing at the target org before the device row moves is checked at COMMIT.
--
-- WHY IT TAKES THE EXPORT LOCKS FIRST. The re-home and the drop both fire the
-- projection trigger, whose UPDATE on devices fires
-- breeze_partner_export_devices_update, which requests that device's org export
-- lock. Those locks must be acquired in ascending UUID order for the whole
-- transaction, and breeze_cascade_device_org_id later requests BOTH orgs. Taking
-- the source alone first would abort the move whenever the target's uuid sorts
-- lower — a coin-flip per move. Pre-acquiring the pair through the same helper
-- (which sorts them itself) makes every later request a held-lock no-op. This is
-- exactly what breeze_cascade_device_org_id does and for exactly the same
-- reason.
--
-- WHY IT IS A DB FUNCTION AND NOT INLINE SQL IN moveOrg.ts. It has to read
-- custom_field_definitions across the org/partner axis, which an org-scoped
-- request context cannot do (#4944), and it has to hold the lock-order knowledge
-- next to the trigger it protects.
--
-- (The org MERGE path deliberately does NOT call this: there the loser's
-- definitions travel to the survivor wholesale, so dropping anything would be
-- data loss. The coherence trigger's merge fence covers that path instead.)

  --    forbids the remaining cross-axis pair. Together: AT MOST ONE definition

  --    enforces visibility on every write, so a device holds at most one value
  --    row per field_key — in the source org and in the target org alike — and

  --    THE NOT EXISTS GUARD IS DEFENCE IN DEPTH, not redundancy. That invariant
  --    is enforced by two migrations' worth of indexes and a trigger, all of

-- Backfill.
--
-- Order inside this file matters: the backfill must run AFTER the projection
-- trigger exists (its INSERT fires the trigger, which recomputes the SAME object
-- it just read, so the devices UPDATE is a guarded no-op) and it must live in
-- THIS file rather than a follow-up one — between two files the projection
-- trigger would rebuild every device's jsonb from an empty table and erase the
-- data.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Mint an org-owned definition for every stored key that has no visible
--    definition and CAN be created (the enforced ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$ pattern).
--    Not doing this would strand those values: the FK needs a definition_id. A
--    camelCase key cannot be minted (the pattern is enforced on every create
--    path) and is instead PRESERVED by the projection trigger's unmanaged
--    branch — counted below so it is on the record either way.
--
--    THE MINTED `type` IS INFERRED, NOT HARDCODED TO 'text'. The jsonb records
--    a real JSON type per value, so `{"seat_count": 4}` is a NUMBER and
--    `{"encrypted": true}` is a BOOLEAN. Minting every orphan key as 'text'
--    would discard that permanently and silently: the copy step's CASE ladder
--    keys off `f.type`, so the value would land in `value_text`, the field would
--    lose typed input and typed comparisons in the UI forever, and no warning
--    would tell an operator which fields to re-type by hand.
--
--    The inference is deliberately CONSERVATIVE — a type is only claimed when
--    EVERY stored value for that (org, key) agrees on it. One device holding
--    `"4"` while another holds `4` mints 'text', which is the safe reading. Even
--    if the inference were wrong, nothing is lost: a value that does not parse
--    for its declared type falls back to `value_text` in the copy step below.
--    Dates are deliberately NOT inferred — a date is a STRING in jsonb and
--    guessing at one from its shape would mistype any string that happens to
--    start with a date, which is not a trade worth making unattended.
