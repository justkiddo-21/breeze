-- RMM-QA-164: reconcile force_mfa on every SYSTEM Partner Admin role.
--
-- 2026-05-25-f-role-force-mfa.sql promised force_mfa = true for the system
-- Partner Admin role, but its UPDATE only touched rows that existed when it
-- ran. autoMigrate applies migrations BEFORE the initial seed() on a fresh
-- database, so the seeded global template stored false; createPartner()
-- inserted every tenant copy without the flag, so those stored false too.
-- The seed and createPartner() now write the flag themselves; this
-- migration fixes forward the rows already on installed databases.
--
-- Scope: the global template (partner_id IS NULL) AND every tenant copy
-- (partner_id set). Custom roles (is_system = false) that happen to share
-- the name are excluded by construction — a user-chosen name is not
-- security policy. Org Admin and the other system roles stay opt-in.
--
-- Side effect (intended): each flipped row fires
-- breeze_roles_permissions_epoch (2026-08-06-b), bumping permissions_epoch
-- for that role's members once. Every Partner Admin without an enrolled
-- factor then receives 428 mfa_enrollment_required on their next
-- non-exempt request until they enrol at /auth/mfa/setup. Relief valve:
-- MFA_FORCE_FOR_PARTNER_ADMIN=false (suppresses only the role-force
-- component; settings-driven requireMfa stays enforced).
--
-- Idempotent: the force_mfa = false predicate makes re-application a no-op.
-- The row count is always logged (a zero is evidence too).
--
-- roles is ENABLE + FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY and breeze_current_scope()
-- defaults to 'none', so on managed Postgres (DigitalOcean / RDS), where
-- DATABASE_URL is NOT a superuser, a contextless UPDATE silently matches zero
-- rows and the ledger records the file as applied anyway — the trap
-- 2026-09-30-100000-rls-scoped-backfill-replay.sql had to fix forward.
-- Elevate for this file's transaction only (autoMigrate wraps each file in
-- one; is_local = true scopes the setting to it). breeze_has_partner_access()
-- is TRUE under system scope, which is what the update policy checks, and
-- the epoch trigger's UPDATE of users runs under the same scope.
