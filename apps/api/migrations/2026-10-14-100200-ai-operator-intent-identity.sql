-- AI Operator W04 (#5205, sub-issue #5209): operation identity on the intent.
--
-- W03 (2026-10-14-100000-ai-operator-thin-slice.sql) created the tables and
-- the three nullable `action_intents` task columns. This migration closes the
-- three gaps W04's code needs and W03's PR body named as deviations:
--
--  1. The `action_intents` immutability trigger's deny-list does NOT yet
--     mention `task_id` / `task_step_key` / `operation_key`, so today a plain
--     UPDATE could re-point a live intent at a DIFFERENT task or rewrite its
--     operation key. That is the whole identity the operation row is keyed
--     on, so it must be as immutable as `argument_digest` and
--     `idempotency_key` already are. All three are set at INSERT and never
--     written again: `action_intents_task_org_fk` is ON DELETE RESTRICT (see
--     the W03 header — SET NULL would strand `task_step_key`/`operation_key`
--     and instantly violate `action_intents_task_link_chk`), so unlike
--     `scope_device_id` / `scope_ticket_id` there is NO non-null -> NULL
--     tombstone transition to carve out. Strict immutability is therefore
--     correct here, not over-tight.
--
--  2. `ai_operator_operations` needs four columns W04 writes:
--       - `plan_revision`        the task revision the approval covers, pinned
--                                at reservation. The dispatch claim requires
--                                `ai_operator_tasks.revision = plan_revision`
--                                in the SAME conditional UPDATE, so a task
--                                whose plan was revised after approval cannot
--                                dispatch the stale operation (spec §7.1,
--                                "revising plan arguments creates a new
--                                operation and approval").
--       - `claimed_lease_epoch`  the scheduler epoch OBSERVED when the claim
--                                was won. Recorded, not fenced on, on the
--                                intent-release path: that path holds no lease,
--                                and spec §6.3 requires results from an
--                                operation a superseded epoch dispatched to be
--                                accepted under their ORIGINAL identity. This
--                                column is how W06 recognises one.
--       - `cancel_requested_at`  cancel-during-`executing` (spec §7.3). The
--                                intent stays `executing` and the effect is
--                                reconciled; this is the durable record that a
--                                human asked for it to stop.
--       - `dispatch_detail`      why a claim was refused (revalidation error
--                                code, tightened policy, lost claim). Bounded
--                                text, never a jsonb container: every jsonb
--                                column is `excludedOpen` in the tenant export
--                                policy, and a refusal reason must be
--                                exportable.
--
--  3. `dispatch_state` gains 'cancelled'. W03's four values
--     ('reserved','dispatched','dispatch_failed','abandoned') cannot express
--     "a human cancelled this before it ever dispatched". Folding that into
--     'abandoned' would make the reconciler's "terminal task with an unsettled
--     operation" scan unable to tell a deliberate cancel from a leaked
--     reservation. 'in_flight' is deliberately NOT added: it would be an exact
--     synonym of the existing 'dispatched', and two names for one state is how
--     a vocabulary rots.
--
-- DDL only. No UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT runs here, so no `breeze.scope` election
-- is required (and none is added — see migrationRlsScope.test.ts).
-- Idempotent throughout. No new RLS policy: `action_intents` and
-- `ai_operator_operations` are both Shape 1 with `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)`
-- policies already declared in their creating migrations, and adding columns
-- does not change a policy.

COMMENT ON COLUMN ai_operator_operations.plan_revision IS
  'ai_operator_tasks.revision pinned at reservation. The dispatch claim requires the task''s CURRENT revision to still equal this, in the same conditional UPDATE — a revised plan refuses the stale operation rather than dispatching it (spec §7.1).';
COMMENT ON COLUMN ai_operator_operations.claimed_lease_epoch IS
  'The ai_operator_tasks.lease_epoch OBSERVED when the dispatch claim was won. Recorded for lineage, not fenced on from the intent-release path (which holds no lease): spec §6.3 requires a result from an operation dispatched by a superseded epoch to be accepted under its ORIGINAL identity.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN ai_operator_operations.cancel_requested_at IS
  'Set when a human cancelled a task-linked intent that had already reached `executing`. The intent deliberately STAYS `executing` (spec §7.3: already-executing commands may finish, are shown in flight, and transition only after reconciliation) — this column is the durable "cancel asked for, reconciliation pending" record.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN ai_operator_operations.dispatch_detail IS
  'Why a dispatch claim was refused or a dispatch failed (revalidation error code, tightened policy, lost claim). Bounded text rather than jsonb because every jsonb column is excludedOpen in CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY and a refusal reason must stay exportable.';

-- 3. action_intents immutability: the three operation-identity columns
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Extend the ONE immutable-content function. Body copied verbatim from its
-- most recent definition, 2026-09-25-ai-agents-ticket-triage.sql, plus the
-- three task columns. (That file is the CURRENT definition; it is not itself
-- byte-identical to the 2026-09-23 one before it, which is why it — and not
-- the original 2026-07-18 creation — is the file to diff against.)
-- Strict `IS DISTINCT FROM` for all three — no null-transition carve-out, see
-- the header.
