-- READ-ONLY preflight for
-- 2026-10-11-141000-custom-field-no-cross-axis-shadowing.sql  (#3257 W03).
--
-- Run on EACH prod region before merging. Query (a) must come back EMPTY.
--
-- This file lives under migrations/preflight/ and is NEVER applied by the
-- runner: `autoMigrate` does a NON-RECURSIVE readdir of the migrations root and
-- keeps only names matching /^\d{4}-.*\.sql$/ (db/autoMigrate.ts), so the
-- subdirectory entry "preflight" is filtered out and its contents are never
-- read. Same arrangement as migrations/optional/ and as W02's preflight
-- (2026-10-10-100300-custom-field-definition-integrity-preflight.sql).
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS. The migration ABORTS the deploy (RAISE EXCEPTION) when it
-- finds any cross-axis shadowed key, and a deploy is the wrong place to
-- discover that. Shadowed pairs are REPORTED, never auto-resolved: the two
-- definitions can disagree on `type` and on dropdown `options`, and
-- devices.custom_fields stores the datum under the bare key with no record of
-- which definition minted it. Deleting either one therefore silently retypes
-- or orphans live values, and consumers hold the key as configuration
-- (services/remoteAccessLauncher.ts `provider.customFieldKey`,
-- services/installerVariables.ts). Reconciliation needs a human decision per
-- pair — which axis keeps the key, and what the loser's values become.
--
-- If (a) comes back NON-EMPTY: stop and escalate. Do NOT merge the migration.
--
-- ============================ READ THIS FIRST ============================
-- THE SCOPE ELEVATION BELOW IS LOAD-BEARING. DO NOT DROP IT, and do not run
-- query (a) standalone without it.
--
-- custom_field_definitions is FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY, which binds the table
-- OWNER as well as ordinary roles. `breeze_current_scope()` defaults to 'none'
-- (0012-tenant-rls-deny-default.sql), under which breeze_has_org_access and
-- breeze_has_partner_access are both false — and the table's dual-axis policy
-- (2026-06-11-i-custom-fields-dual-axis-rls.sql) is exactly the OR of those
-- two. So on any connection that does not bypass RLS — which includes prod,
-- managed DO Postgres reached as the non-superuser `doadmin` — an unelevated
-- run of (a) returns ZERO ROWS WHILE COMPLETELY BLIND, and an operator reads
-- that empty result as "clean". That false negative is the entire failure mode
-- this preflight exists to prevent, so it must not be reachable from the
-- preflight itself.
--
-- Query (0) prints the effective scope and a row count on BOTH axes, and the
-- `DO` block after it makes a blind connection FAIL CLOSED rather than merely
-- self-evident: it raises, which aborts the transaction, so query (a) below
-- cannot return a reassuring empty result set at all — it errors with 25P02
-- instead. That matters because the whole point of this file is that an
-- operator decides "merge / don't merge" from query (a)'s emptiness, and
-- "empty because clean" and "empty because blind" are indistinguishable by
-- eye. Leaving it to a human to cross-check two columns before trusting a
-- third result is exactly the reasoning-from-a-blind-read this file exists to
-- prevent, so it is enforced mechanically here the same way it is in the
-- migration.
--
-- A zero `total_rows` is NOT raised on: a region can legitimately have no
-- custom fields at all (breeze-eu had 0 when this shipped). Only the scope is
-- machine-checkable; the counts are for the human record.
--
-- Wrapped in BEGIN READ ONLY / ROLLBACK so the elevation is transaction-local
-- (set_config's third argument is is_local=true, which needs an explicit
-- transaction to span more than one statement) and so the session cannot write
-- anything even by accident. The "no inner BEGIN/COMMIT" migration rule does
-- NOT apply here — that rule exists because autoMigrate wraps each migration
-- file in its own transaction, and this file is never run by autoMigrate.
-- =========================================================================

BEGIN READ ONLY;

-- (0) Sanity: prove the connection is NOT RLS-blind before trusting (a).
--     org_rows and partner_rows are split because a region can legitimately
--     have zero partner-wide definitions while still having org-owned ones;
--     a zero on BOTH where fields are known to exist means blindness.

-- (0b) FAIL CLOSED on a blind connection. Printing the scope above is not
--      enough: the decision this file drives is made from query (a)'s
--      EMPTINESS, and "empty because clean" looks exactly like "empty because
--      RLS-blind". Raising here aborts the transaction, so query (a) cannot
--      return a reassuring empty result at all — it errors with 25P02
--      ("current transaction is aborted") and the operator cannot mistake it
--      for a pass. `RAISE EXCEPTION` is legal inside `BEGIN READ ONLY`; the
--      ROLLBACK at the bottom simply closes the aborted transaction.
