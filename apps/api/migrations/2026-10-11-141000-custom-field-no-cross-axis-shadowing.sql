-- 2026-10-11-141000-custom-field-no-cross-axis-shadowing.sql   (#3257 W03)
--
-- ONE EFFECTIVE field_key NAMESPACE PER DEVICE.
--
-- custom_field_definitions is dual-axis (org_id XOR partner_id, W02's
-- custom_field_definitions_one_owner_chk), but devices.custom_fields is a FLAT
-- jsonb object keyed by a bare string. When an org-owned `udf7` and a
-- partner-wide `udf7` both exist for one org, that ONE datum has TWO
-- definitions, and three things break at once:
--
--   1. The partner export emits TWO records for the one datum, each under a
--      different synthetic id, because the identity hash includes f.id
--      (routes/partnerApi/configuration.ts:436,439).
--   2. #3257 W05's normalized device_custom_field_values table cannot project
--      back into the jsonb without loss -- two definition_ids, one key.
--   3. W05's backfill cannot attribute an EXISTING blob value to one of the
--      two definitions, because the blob records no definition_id and the two
--      definitions may disagree on `type` and on dropdown `options`.
--
-- WHY A TRIGGER AND NOT AN INDEX. The rule is "the partner-wide key set and
-- the union of that partner's org-owned key sets are disjoint". That spans two
-- NULLABLE ownership columns over DISJOINT row sets, and the partner half of
-- the pair is not even on the org-owned row -- it is reached through
-- organizations.partner_id. No index can express it (which is why W02 needed
-- two PARTIAL unique indexes rather than one composite). W02 deliberately left
-- this cross-axis case legal and pinned it as a passing boundary case in
-- customFieldDefinitionIntegrity.integration.test.ts; this file closes it.
--
-- Existing shadowed pairs are REPORTED, never resolved. Deleting either
-- definition silently retypes or orphans every value already stored under that
-- key (the survivor dictates `type`; values carry none), and consumers hold the
-- key as configuration (services/remoteAccessLauncher.ts `provider.customFieldKey`,
-- services/installerVariables.ts). So this file WARNs the count and the
-- affected pairs, then RAISEs to abort the deploy: a WARNING alone returns
-- SUCCESS and autoMigrate records the file as applied FOREVER (db/autoMigrate.ts
-- wraps each file in client.begin; only an exception rolls it back), which
-- would leave prod permanently without the trigger while the ledger claims
-- otherwise. A read-only preflight
-- (migrations/preflight/2026-10-11-141000-custom-field-shadowing-preflight.sql)
-- ran against both prod regions before this merged -- see the PR body.
--
-- WHY THE SCOPE ELEVATION, on a file that writes no rows. CLAUDE.md states the
-- rule for WRITES, but the same mechanism silently corrupts a detection READ,
-- and here that is the more dangerous half (the lesson W02 banked).
-- custom_field_definitions and organizations are both FORCE ROW LEVEL
-- SECURITY, which binds the table OWNER -- the role migrations run as.
-- breeze_current_scope() defaults to 'none', under which breeze_has_org_access
-- and breeze_has_partner_access are both false, so on any connection that does
-- not bypass RLS the detection block below would join ZERO rows to ZERO rows
-- and cheerfully RAISE WARNING '... 0 cross-axis shadowed keys'. The deploy
-- would then proceed to install the trigger over dirty data, and the first
-- operator to touch either definition would get an unactionable P0001 from a
-- trigger nobody knew was armed.
--
-- WHICH DEPLOYMENTS THAT IS. Not hosted prod, most likely: `doadmin` on managed
-- DO Postgres is a non-superuser but DOES carry BYPASSRLS (this is why the 122
-- legacy row-writing migrations still apply -- scripts/check-migrations-nonsuperuser.ts
-- reproduces exactly that attribute set), and CI runs as an outright superuser.
-- It is a self-hosted or future migration role WITHOUT BYPASSRLS that reads
-- blind here, and neither of the two environments we actually run can show it.
-- Same reasoning applies to the trigger function further down; see its header.
-- set_config(..., true) is transaction-local, and autoMigrate's per-file
-- client.begin is that transaction.
SELECT set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true);

-- Blindness probe. Prints what the detection block below is actually able to
-- see BEFORE it reports a verdict, so a "0 shadowed keys" line can be trusted.
-- A total_rows of 0 on a region known to have custom fields configured, or an
-- effective_scope that is not 'system', means the elevation above did not take

-- The enforcement trigger.
--
-- READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING THE FUNCTION HEADER OR THE FIRST/LAST LINES OF THE
-- BODY. `SET search_path` and the in-body scope elevation are both
-- load-bearing and neither is boilerplate.
--
--   SET search_path = pg_catalog, public
--     Standard SECURITY DEFINER hygiene: the function must not resolve
--     `custom_field_definitions` through a caller-controlled search_path.
--     `search_path` is a BUILT-IN GUC, so the attribute form is available to
--     any role -- unlike the custom `breeze.scope` GUC below.
--
--   PERFORM set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true)  -- first line of body
--     WITHOUT THIS THE TRIGGER IS A NO-OP FOR THE EXACT CASE IT EXISTS TO
--     CATCH, on any deployment whose lookups are subject to RLS. The blind
--     spot is not hypothetical and it is not symmetric:
--
--       * An ORG-scoped session inserting an org-owned `udf7` must look for a
--         PARTNER-WIDE `udf7`. custom_field_definitions has no partner-wide
--         SELECT branch yet (it sits in PARTNER_WIDE_SELECT_BRANCH_EXEMPT in
--         rls-coverage.integration.test.ts against open follow-up #4944), so an
--         org token CANNOT see partner-wide rows at all. An unelevated lookup
--         returns nothing and the shadowing insert is waved through -- and that
--         is the single most common way this collision gets created, because
--         the POST /custom-fields handler pins orgId = auth.orgId for every
--         org-scoped caller (routes/customFields.ts).
--       * A PARTNER-scoped session inserting a partner-wide key must look at
--         org-owned rows across ALL of that partner's orgs -- including orgs
--         outside the caller's own accessible_org_ids.
--
--     SECURITY DEFINER IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE, AND IT HIDES THE GAP IN CI. It
--     switches to the function OWNER -- the role that applied the migration --
--     so whether RLS still applies depends entirely on that role's attributes,
--     which differ per deployment and which this file cannot know:
--       - CI and local: `breeze_test` (rolsuper=t, rolbypassrls=t) ignores RLS
--         outright, so the guard behaves identically with or without the
--         elevation. Nothing here can be defended behaviourally on this stack.
--       - Hosted prod: `doadmin` on managed DO Postgres is NOT a superuser but
--         DOES carry BYPASSRLS (this is why the 122 legacy row-writing
--         migrations still apply -- see scripts/check-migrations-nonsuperuser.ts,
--         which reproduces exactly that attribute set). So hosted prod is
--         probably covered by ownership alone TODAY.
--       - Self-hosted / any future owner without BYPASSRLS: not covered. FORCE
--         ROW LEVEL SECURITY binds the owner, breeze_current_scope() defaults
--         to 'none', and breeze_has_org_access / breeze_has_partner_access are
--         then both false (0008-tenant-rls.sql,
--         2026-04-11-a-rls-function-bootstrap.sql).
--     The elevation is what makes the guard correct in ALL THREE cases instead
--     of only the two we happen to run today. It is not redundant with
--     SECURITY DEFINER; it is what stops the guard from being silently
--     ownership-dependent.
--
--     MEASURED, not assumed (local PG16, this migration set, A/B with the
--     elevation as the sole variable): two otherwise identical SECURITY DEFINER
--     lookups reassigned to the non-superuser, non-BYPASSRLS `breeze_app` and
--     called under an org-scoped context returned unelevated => row NOT found,
--     elevated => row found. And with the elevation stripped, every
--     behavioural test in customFieldShadowing.integration.test.ts still
--     passed, because this stack's owner is a superuser. So NO behavioural test
--     can defend these lines here; the catalog assertion in that suite ('pins
--     the in-body scope elevation') is what does. Do not delete either half.
--
--     WHY IN-BODY set_config AND NOT A FUNCTION-LEVEL `SET "breeze.scope"`.
--     The attribute form is the more elegant one -- PostgreSQL saves it on
--     entry and restores it on every exit path including through an error --
--     BUT SETTING A CUSTOM (dotted) GUC AS A FUNCTION ATTRIBUTE IS
--     SUPERUSER-ONLY. A non-superuser migration role gets
--     `42501 permission denied to set parameter "breeze.scope"` the moment the
--     CREATE FUNCTION runs, which on prod means the deploy crash-loops on boot
--     before it serves a request. That is the v0.97.0
--     EU incident, and src/db/migrationGucAttributes.test.ts exists to keep it
--     from recurring; Check Migrations (non-superuser) is the backstop.
--     `set_config()` at RUNTIME is not privilege-gated, so the sanctioned
--     pattern is save/elevate/restore in the body -- reference implementation:
--     2026-07-27-a-feature-policy-reference-ownership.sql
--     (breeze_revalidate_config_policy_feature_references).
--
--     THE RESTORE IS NOT OPTIONAL AND THE BODY IS SHAPED AROUND IT. A missed
--     restore would leave the CALLER'S transaction running at system scope,
--     which is a tenant-isolation hole worse than the bug being fixed. Two
--     things make that unreachable here: the body has exactly ONE `RETURN`,
--     immediately preceded by the restore (there is deliberately no early
--     return -- the `owner_partner IS NULL` case falls through instead), and
--     every RAISE path aborts the (sub)transaction, which rolls the GUC back
--     to its saved value without any code running. The elevated region does
--     nothing but two SELECTs, an advisory lock and a RAISE -- no writes, no
--     dynamic SQL.
--
-- ON `CONSTRAINT =` IN THE RAISEs. P0001 is Postgres's GENERIC code for any
-- unqualified RAISE EXCEPTION, so a route branching on the code alone would
-- mislabel a future unrelated P0001 raised by some other trigger on this table.
-- Setting CONSTRAINT makes the error self-identifying: it lands on the driver
-- error as `constraint_name`, reachable via pgErrorNode(), so a caller that
-- ever needs to disambiguate can, without parsing the message. Nothing depends
-- on it today (routes/customFields.ts matches P0001, which is currently unique
-- to this trigger on this table) -- it is here so that stays cheap to fix.
--
-- ON THE ERROR MESSAGE. It names the field_key and the axis it collides on,
-- and deliberately NOTHING else -- not the other definition's id, name, or
-- owning org. An org-scoped caller cannot otherwise see partner-wide rows, so
-- the message is the minimum disclosure needed to make the refusal actionable
-- ("your partner already owns this key") without turning the trigger into a
-- partner-wide field enumeration oracle.
--
-- ON THE ADVISORY LOCK. Two concurrent transactions -- one inserting the
-- org-owned side, one the partner-wide side -- would each run their own EXISTS
-- check, each see nothing (READ COMMITTED cannot see the other's uncommitted
-- row), and both commit. pg_advisory_xact_lock on (partner, field_key)
-- serializes them: both branches derive the SAME lock key from the SAME
-- partner uuid and field_key, so the loser blocks until the winner commits and
-- then sees the committed row. Class id 1000257 = issue #3257; the existing
-- 10002xx/10003xx classes belong to the partner-export and config-assignment
-- serializers (2026-07-21-partner-export-canonical-org-mutations.sql,
-- 2026-07-30-serialize-bulk-config-assignment-target-moves.sql).
