-- Phase D2 (payment push) — Task 1.
--
-- accounting_connections gains the Breeze -> QuickBooks payment push switch.
-- accounting_entity_mappings becomes its own outbox: `pending_op` records the
-- operation the row still owes QuickBooks, `claimed_at` is the worker's lease,
-- `sync_attempts` bounds how long a doomed push keeps asking, and
-- `breeze_origin` tells the CDC pull that Breeze — not QuickBooks — is the
-- system of record for this payment (a CDC DELETION carries no PrivateNote, so
-- origin has to be known locally).
--
-- No RLS changes: both tables are partner-axis and already ENABLE + FORCE with
-- partner policies (2026-09-28-quickbooks-entity-mappings.sql:150-168). No
-- org_id anywhere, so no tenantCascade / export-policy / orgMerge REGISTRATION
-- is required. Those files were still CHANGED by this work, for the opposite
-- reason: `accounting_entity_mappings` was already reachable from the org
-- cascade and the merge orphan sweep through an invoices/invoice_payments join,
-- and both now EXCLUDE `pending_op = 'delete'` so an owed QuickBooks deletion is
-- not silently discarded (see the retention comments there).
--
-- The entity-partner guard trigger fires only on INSERT and
-- UPDATE OF partner_id, breeze_entity_type, breeze_entity_id, so a row whose
-- invoice_payments target has already been deleted can legally carry
-- pending_op = 'delete' until QuickBooks confirms the removal.

-- gives up: `pending_op` is cleared and `last_error` says so, which is what

-- deletes a Breeze-created Payment by hand in QuickBooks, the pull clears
-- `remote_entity_id` and the invoice fan-out re-owns the row for a new create;
-- re-sending the same `requestid` would replay the ORIGINAL response, so the
-- worker would report success and stamp the mapping synced with the id of a
-- Payment that no longer exists (sandbox walk item 32 — silent data loss).
-- The generation is bumped by that re-own and appended to the requestid
-- (`<invoice_payments.id>:g<n>`), so it changes per ownership yet stays STABLE
-- across BullMQ retries of the same ownership — which is what keeps the retry
-- idempotency the requestid exists for. 0 means "never re-owned" and keeps the
-- bare payment id as the requestid, so every existing row is unaffected.
-- The PrivateNote adoption marker is deliberately NOT generation-tagged.

-- Review wave 2, finding 6: WHEN the row started owing its `pending_op`.
--

-- `remote_entity_id`) for PAYMENT_DELETE_UNRESOLVED_GRACE_MS before dropping it
-- loudly, and that window has to be measured from when the DEBT began. It

-- read there never expires. It cannot be `created_at` either — that is the age
-- of the MAPPING. A mapping the invoice fan-out re-owned, or one that has
-- simply been synced for a week, is already older than the window on the day
-- its payment is voided, so the row was dropped on its FIRST attempt instead of
-- getting the 24 hours the CDC pull needs to adopt the Payment.
--
-- Written by every writer of `pending_op` that starts a NEW debt
-- (insertPendingPushMapping, requestPaymentDelete, convertToDelete,
-- reownPushMapping) and left alone by the ones that merely keep an existing one
-- (the CDC adoption of a delete-pending row). NULL is tolerated and falls back

-- Review wave 2, finding 2: the horizon that keeps this feature off HISTORY.
--
-- `push_payments` defaults to true, so at deploy every connected realm starts
-- pushing. Without a horizon the invoice fan-out would create a QuickBooks
-- Payment for EVERY unmapped `invoice_payments` row of any invoice that is
-- re-pushed — including receipts the partner's bookkeeper had already entered
-- in QuickBooks by hand for years, which arrive as duplicate cash against the
-- same invoice. Nothing about the mapping tables can tell those apart: they have
-- no mapping precisely because they predate the feature.
--
-- So Breeze only pushes payments RECORDED AFTER the switch became active.
-- Existing connections are stamped `now()` at migration time; new ones are
-- stamped at insert; and the settings route re-stamps it whenever the operator
-- flips `push_payments` off and back on, so a deliberate pause does not later
-- flush a backlog nobody expected.

-- Review wave 3, finding D1: the record_failed bound needs its OWN counter.
--
-- `record_failed` means QuickBooks accepted a create Breeze could not record.
-- The row keeps `pending_op = 'push'` so the CDC echo can adopt the orphan and
-- so each retry resends the SAME requestid (Intuit replays the original
-- response for 24 hours) — but it MUST stop before that window closes, or the
-- next retry mints a second real Payment.
--
-- Inferring the count from a `last_error` prefix did not hold: any other stamp
-- on the same row while it still owes a push — a QuickBooks rejection, an
-- invoice_not_synced refusal, a not-connected skip — rewrites `last_error`, so
-- the next record_failed reads as the first and the bound never trips. This
-- column is written only by that one path, incremented inside the UPDATE (never
-- read-modify-write, so a concurrent stamp cannot lose a count), and it is the
-- ONLY thing the retirement decision reads.

-- Review wave 4, finding A: the TERMINAL state gets a typed column.
--
-- Three states end a mapping's life, and they are not interchangeable:
--   'orphaned'          QuickBooks accepted a create Breeze could not record and
--                       the retry budget is spent. A Payment exists that Breeze
--                       must never create again — re-owning this row DUPLICATES
--                       real money.
--   'gave_up'           the push burned PAYMENT_PUSH_MAX_ATTEMPTS. Nothing exists
--                       remotely; re-pushing the invoice is the documented fix,
--                       so this row IS re-ownable.
--   'removed_remotely'  somebody deleted a Breeze-created Payment in QuickBooks.
--                       Also re-ownable — that is how the re-push happens.
--
-- All three leave the same row SHAPE (breeze_origin, no remote id, nothing
-- owed), so the code was telling them apart by matching `last_error` against a
-- message constant. That is not a state machine: `last_error` is display text
-- rewritten by every other failure path (a QuickBooks rejection, a
-- not-connected skip), so one unrelated stamp turned an orphan back into a
-- re-ownable row and the next invoice push duplicated the Payment.
--
-- The second CHECK is the invariant that makes the pair readable: a row that has
-- ENDED owes nothing. Every writer that starts new work clears the reason in the
-- same UPDATE that sets `pending_op`.
