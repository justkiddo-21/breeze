-- #3182 -- device_group_memberships is tenant-scoped by its own org_id column
-- ALONE. The RLS policies ask "does the caller have access to this row's
-- org_id?" and never "does this row's group_id (or device_id) belong to that
-- org?", so both of these shapes are structurally legal today:
--
--   { group_id: <org A's group>, device_id: <org B's device>, org_id: B }
--   { group_id: <org A's group>, device_id: <org B's device>, org_id: A }
--
-- The issue filed this as defense-in-depth, on the reading that producing such
-- a row needs direct breeze_app credentials. It does not: the FIRST shape is
-- produced by the supported device organization-move path. Moving device D
-- from org A to org B re-stamps every device-child table's org_id to the
-- target org -- via this file's breeze_cascade_device_org_id() (whose generic
-- loop runs over breeze_device_child_orgid_tables(), a function that
-- DISCOVERS every public table carrying both a uuid device_id and org_id;
-- device_group_memberships qualifies) and via the mirrored loop in
-- routes/devices/moveOrg.ts. D's membership rows keep naming org A's group
-- while claiming org B.
--
-- Two system-side readers then dereference those rows by group_id:
--   * jobs/backupSlaWorker.ts resolveTargetDeviceIds() -- no org predicate at
--     all, under withSystemDbAccessContext (RLS bypassed), so an org A backup
--     SLA config targeting org A's group resolves org B's device D and writes
--     breach events for it stamped with org A's org_id.
--   * jobs/automationWorker.ts and the identical resolver in
--     jobs/patchSchedulerWorker.ts -- the partner-owned-policy branch clamps
--     through the MEMBERSHIP's org, never the group's, so within one partner D
--     is resolved for a policy assigned to org A's group.
-- All three readers are given explicit org predicates in the same PR; this
-- file is the structural half, which closes the shape for every future writer
-- too.
--
-- Both composite-FK targets already exist and are reused, not created:
--   device_groups_id_org_id_uniq  (2026-10-06-100100, added for contract_lines)
--   devices_id_org_id_uniq        (2026-07-23-partner-export-material-state-hardening)

-- device_group_memberships is ENABLE + FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
-- (2026-04-11-bucket-c-phase-4-session-execution-rls.sql) and autoMigrate sets
-- no scope, so without the system scope the pre-flight below would count and
-- delete 0 rows on managed Postgres (non-superuser admin) and the FKs would
-- then abort boot on the rows it never saw. is_local = true scopes it to this
-- file's transaction. Same reasoning as 2026-10-06-100100.
SELECT set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true);

-- Pre-flight repair. Unlike 2026-10-06-100100 (which RAISEs on a contract_lines
-- org mismatch), violating rows here are the EXPECTED product of a supported
-- workflow -- every past cross-org device move left some -- so raising would
-- brick the upgrade on every real database. They are deleted instead: a
-- membership naming a foreign org's group has no legitimate repair, since a
-- device in org B cannot be a member of org A's group and there is no
-- destination group to re-point it to.
--
-- The counts are reported UNCONDITIONALLY, including zero. These rows are
-- potential evidence of a tenant-isolation problem, so "we looked and found
-- none" has to be in the Postgres log too -- a silent no-op is
-- indistinguishable from a migration that never ran (CLAUDE.md's
-- cleanup-statement rule). Group and device mismatches are counted separately
-- for attribution but deleted as one union, and the deleted total is the real
-- ROW_COUNT so a row violating BOTH axes is not double-counted.

-- GROUP axis: DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED. An earlier version of this

-- action_intents_scope_ticket_org_fk, contract_lines_device_group_org_fk) on
-- the reasoning that nothing writes device_groups during a devices org-move,
-- so the detach below always empties this table before the generic re-stamp
-- loop can reach it. That reasoning covers the detach's OWN statement, but
-- not the loop's: the detach and the loop's
-- `UPDATE public.device_group_memberships SET org_id = ...` are two SEPARATE
-- statements within this one trigger invocation, hence two separate MVCC
-- snapshots under READ COMMITTED, and CI caught the gap between them
-- (job 100797126274, shard 2/4) — all three device-move-detaches-memberships
-- cases 23503'd against this exact FK from inside the loop's own EXECUTE, no
-- local reproduction found despite extensive ordering/isolation attempts.
-- IMMEDIATE turns any row that lands in that gap into a hard abort of the
-- entire device move, mid-statement, with no chance to self-correct.
-- DEFERRABLE at all is mandatory regardless -- orgLifecycleFoundations.
-- integration.test.ts rejects any non-deferrable FK referencing a parent
-- org_id, because the org merge runs SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED and
-- repoints devices, device_groups and device_group_memberships in separate
-- statements. Deferring THIS FK too costs only WHEN a genuine violation is
-- reported (COMMIT instead of mid-statement), same as the device axis below
-- -- and buys the second cleanup pass after the generic loop (also in this
-- file, fenced the same way as the detach) room to self-correct anything
-- that lands in the gap before COMMIT ever checks it. A lone
-- `db.execute(...)` statement (no
-- explicit surrounding transaction) still autocommits immediately after
-- itself, so a direct forged INSERT/UPDATE against this table -- the shape
-- covered by the two REJECTS tests in
-- deviceGroupMembershipTenantFks.integration.test.ts -- is unaffected: its
-- implicit one-statement transaction ends, and is checked, right where it
-- always was.

  -- Same class as the action_intents tombstones, but placed FIRST rather than
  -- beside them, for a reason specific to this table: deleting a membership
  -- fires breeze_touch_devices_after_membership_delete, which acquires the
  -- partner-export EXCLUSIVE org lock for the deleted rows' org (the SOURCE
  -- org) before touching devices.partner_export_updated_at. Those locks must
  -- be taken in ascending UUID order across the whole transaction, and
  -- breeze_partner_export_devices_update -- an AFTER STATEMENT trigger on this
  -- same devices UPDATE -- goes on to request BOTH orgs. Letting the touch
  -- trigger set the high-water mark to the source org alone would then abort
  -- the move with 'partner export organization locks must be acquired in
  -- ascending UUID order' whenever the TARGET org's uuid happens to sort
  -- lower: a coin-flip per move. So take both orgs up front, in the order the
  -- helper itself sorts them into, before anything else in this function
  -- acquires one. Every later request for either org then hits the helper's
  -- already-held short-circuit and is a no-op.

  -- Note for a future bulk-move feature: this runs PER ROW, so it sorts one
  -- (OLD, NEW) pair at a time, whereas breeze_partner_export_devices_update

  -- merge's bulk repoint is always (loser -> survivor) and is skipped by the
  -- fence below anyway -- so per-row sorting is equivalent. A statement that
  -- moved devices between SEVERAL different org pairs at once could visit rows
  -- in an order that violates the ascending rule; such a feature must either
  -- keep one org pair per statement or pre-acquire the whole set here.
