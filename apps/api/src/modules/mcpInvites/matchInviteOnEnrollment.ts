/**
 * Closes the deployment-invite funnel when an agent enrolls.
 *
 * Task 5.3 of the MCP bootstrap plan: when a device enrolls using a child
 * enrollment key that was minted by `send_deployment_invites`, flip the
 * corresponding `deployment_invites` row from `clicked`/`sent` to `enrolled`
 * so `get_invite_funnel` can report accurate funnel metrics.
 *
 * This is best-effort — a manual enrollment (no matching invite row) or a
 * second heartbeat from an already-enrolled device is a silent no-op. Errors
 * never bubble; they're logged and swallowed so they cannot fail the
 * enrollment response.
 *
 * Match rule: `deployment_invites.enrollment_key_id` stores the child-key id
 * that `sendDeploymentInvites` minted, and the agent enrolls with that same
 * child key, so an equality match on the key id is sufficient. No parent
 * traversal is required (the enrollment_keys table has no parentId column).
 *
 * Idempotent: the `isNull(enrolledAt)` guard means re-enrollments of the same
 * device don't clobber the first-enrolled timestamp.
