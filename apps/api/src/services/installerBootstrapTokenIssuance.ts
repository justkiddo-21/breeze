  // (see the class doc above), which is exactly the contract that let one
  // caller slip through uncapped. Two of the three current callers
  // (POST /:id/bootstrap-token and the installer-link/installer-download
  // Windows paths) already reject an over-cap explicit ttlMinutes upstream
  // via assertTtlWithinCap, so for them this is a same-value no-op. The
  // THIRD caller — serveInstaller's UNAUTHENTICATED public-download / short-
  // link path — passes no ttlMinutes at all and had no cap consult anywhere
  // in its call chain before this fix, so the 24h bootstrapTokenExpiresAt()
  // base could exceed a partner's configured (lower) cap. Bounding it HERE,
  // once, means the contract stops depending on every future caller
  // remembering to check the cap itself.

  // Pass `rawExpiresAt` through VERBATIM when the cap does not bind (fix
  // round 4, #2776).
  //
  // What the round-3 code actually did — the round-3 comment described this
  // backwards, claiming `Math.ceil` produced 1441 minutes. It cannot: the
  // quotient here is `requestedMinutes - elapsed/60000`, where `elapsed` is
  // the time between building `rawExpiresAt` and re-reading the clock on the
  // next line. That is strictly LESS than the requested minutes, so `ceil`
  // lands back on exactly 1440 and never above it. The real defect was the
  // unconditional REBUILD on the line after: `new Date(Date.now() + ...)` reads
  // the clock a third time, so the reconstructed expiry sat a few
  // MILLISECONDS past `rawExpiresAt`. Tiny, but it is drift in the lengthening
  // direction inside the function whose job is to bound lifetimes, and it
  // accumulated nowhere-visible. Keeping `rawExpiresAt` when the cap is
  // non-binding removes the round trip entirely, so there is no drift of
  // either sign.
  //
  // `floor` (with a 1-minute floor for sub-minute requests) rather than `ceil`
  // so the minute-quantised value handed to the cap never rounds a request UP
  // past what was asked for.
  //
  // KNOWN BOUNDARY (not a bug worth behaviour-changing, but do not claim the
  // clamp "only rewrites downwards"): because `rawTtlMinutes` floors, a cap
  // sitting exactly one minute below the request is NON-binding. Cap 1439 with
  // a 1440-minute request floors to 1439, `clampTtlToCap` returns 1439, the
  // `>=` test passes, and the token is issued at the full 1440 — up to 60
  // seconds OVER the cap. Bounded at <1 minute and irrelevant against the
  // hour-scale caps this feature exists for; the alternative (rebuilding from
  // the capped minutes) reintroduces the millisecond drift above on every
  // single issue, which is the worse trade.
