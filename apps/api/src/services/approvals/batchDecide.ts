/**
 * P2-2 (#4189): decide MANY approval cards with ONE assertion ceremony.
 *
 * A scheduled sweep proposes one intent — and therefore one approval card —
 * per device, so a fleet-wide finding lands in the approver's inbox as N
 * identical cards. Deciding them one at a time means N WebAuthn / Secure
 * Enclave ceremonies for what is, to the human, a single decision.
 *
 * The safety of collapsing those N ceremonies into one rests entirely on the
 * HOMOGENEITY rule below: the set must be one decision. Every row must be
 *   - still `pending`,
 *   - fanned out to the deciding user,
 *   - linked to a SUPERVISED, AGENT-ORIGINATED intent (`approvalScope ===
 *     'supervised'` AND `requestingAgentRunId != null`), and
 *   - in the same `(orgId, actionToolName, normalized action)` group.
 * Anything else fails the WHOLE batch with 422 and decides nothing — never a
 * partial decide off a set the approver may have misread. Four-eyes cards are
 * excluded structurally (they are never `supervised`), so the two-person rule
 * can never be satisfied by a batch tap.
 *
 * What is NOT collapsed: every row still runs the full per-row decide core
 * (`decideApprovalRequest`) — live agent-decide authority, digest binding,
 * the approval CAS, the intent fan-in, the release lease, events. Only the
 * assurance LADDER is hoisted, because the challenge it consumes is
 * single-use. A row that fails its own gates (409 on a lost race, 410 on
 * expiry, 403 on lost authority) does not stop the others; its result is
 * reported alongside theirs.
 */

/** Hard cap on one batch. Matches the inbox page size (`PENDING_PAGE_MAX`),
