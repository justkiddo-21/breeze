/**
 * Drop `orgId` from `partners.settings.organizationOrder`, if present. Called
 * post-commit after an org is permanently destroyed (org merge, Task 4) so a
 * dead id doesn't linger in the partner's saved order forever.
 *
 * Purely cosmetic, by design: `applyOrganizationOrder` already tolerates a
 * stale id (it's simply never matched, same as any other id an org list no
 * longer contains), so leaving this unfixed would never break the UI — it
 * would just keep a phantom entry in the persisted array. Never scoped by
 * `isNull(partners.deletedAt)`: a partner mid-erasure of its own should not
 * make this throw, and the caller treats the whole call as best-effort
 * anyway (its own try/catch).
 *
 * No-op (no write) when the partner has no saved order or the id isn't in
 * it, so a merge under a partner that never set a custom order costs nothing
 * beyond the one read.
