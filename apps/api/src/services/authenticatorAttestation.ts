 *
 * A server challenge is not optional garnish here: both Apple App Attest
 * (`clientDataHash`) and Android Key Attestation (`setAttestationChallenge`)
 * only mean anything if the value they commit to was chosen by the server for
 * this one registration. Without it, an attestation captured once could be
