/**
 * P2-5 (#4192, Task A2-5) — the PROMOTE executor.
 *
 * The one and only writer that ADDS a colon key to an organization's
 * `ai_agents.actAssets.supervisedActionKeys` — the list `attemptPolicyDecision`
 * consults to release a Tier-3 intent without human fanout. It runs from the
 * `manage_ai_agents:authorize_supervised_key` tool handler, i.e. only ever as
 * the effect of a Tier-3 FOUR-EYES action intent that a second human approved
 * (`services/aiToolsAiAgentGovernance.ts`).
 *
 * APPROVAL TIME IS NOT EXECUTION TIME. Everything the approver relied on is
 * re-established here, under the per-tuple advisory lock, immediately before
 * the write:
 *
 *   - the feature flag (`BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED`) is re-read
 *     LIVE — a flag flipped off during the approval window must not grant;
 *   - the authorizing intent is re-loaded and must name THIS org and carry no
 *     `requesting_agent_run_id` (human origin);
 *   - eligibility is recomputed from the evidence ledger, and the partner
 *     ceiling is re-checked — a key demoted or dropped from the baseline in
 *     the meantime is refused.
 *
 * Every one of those is a REFUSAL, never a silent skip: the handler turns a
 * `SupervisedKeyGrantError` into a returned tool error, which the release
 * paths terminalize as `failed:tool_returned_error` rather than recording a
 * grant that never happened as a success.
 *
 * A DUPLICATE REQUEST IS A REFUSAL TOO, and it is the one refusal whose
 * observable outcome an operator will actually meet, so it is spelled out
 * here for the approvals UI (Tasks 17/18): a second approved intent naming a
 * key this org already holds terminalizes `failed` with reason
 * `already_granted`. The array invariant the plan asks for ("a duplicate key
 * => idempotent, one entry") holds either way — the key is never appended
 * twice — but the two readings differ in what the RECORD says, and the
 * refusal is the one that keeps it honest:
 *
 *   - `ai_agent_graduation.promoted_intent_id` / `promoted_at` keep naming
 *     the approval that ACTUALLY granted the key. Completing the duplicate
 *     would either overwrite that provenance or complete an intent with no
 *     audit row behind it — a hole in the trail for an authority grant.
 *   - there is exactly ONE `ai.agent.supervised_key.authorized` audit row per
 *     real grant, never one per approval of it.
 *   - no legitimate retry is ever mis-reported as a duplicate: this executor
 *     cannot be re-entered for the same intent. The release worker claims the
 *     row with a CAS `approved -> executing` before calling any tool, a BullMQ
 *     redelivery loses that CAS and exits without executing, and the
 *     stale-executing reaper (`jobs/intentExpiryReaper.ts`) TERMINALIZES a
 *     stuck row rather than re-releasing it. `already_granted` therefore only
 *     ever means a genuinely second request.
 *
 * A UI that wants to soften this should render the reason, not re-run the
 * grant: `already_granted` is the "nothing to do, the key is live" signal.
 *
 * TENANCY. The whole executor runs in ONE system transaction (the partner
 * baseline row is invisible to an org-scoped reader), so — per this repo's
 * invariant — every statement predicates on `org_id`/`partner_id` explicitly
 * even though RLS passes unconditionally there. `orgId` itself is never
 * trusted from tool arguments: the handler has already compared it against
 * the executing auth context's org, and the first thing below re-compares it
 * against the intent's own immutable `org_id`.

/**
 * The org row a fresh clone must carry so the agent keeps behaving EXACTLY as
 * it does today. A row built from schema defaults would land `enabled: false`,
 * `mode: 'off'` and an empty allowlist — i.e. promoting a key would silently
 * turn the org's agent off, which is the opposite of what the approver
 * authorized.
 *
 * The material is `mergeAgentPolicies(partner, null, …).effective`, NOT
 * `resolveEffectiveAgentSystem`: that loader additionally forces
 * `enabled: false` when the `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_ENABLED` kill switch is off, and
 * persisting a kill-switch artifact into a policy row would outlive the switch.
 * `allowedModels` is irrelevant to this branch by construction — it only ever
 * selects between an ORG model and the partner's, and this branch runs only
 * when there is no org row — so the merge is called with `null` rather than
 * paying for an `ai_budgets` read whose value cannot change the outcome.
 *
 * Two fields deliberately do NOT come from `effective`:
 *   - `instructions` stays NULL. The effective value is the RENDERED
 *     `[partner guidance]…` block; storing it as the ORG's own instructions
 *     would make the next merge wrap it a second time inside
 *     `[organization guidance]`. Partner instructions already flow through
 *     the merge, so NULL is the neutral override.
 *   - `supervisedActionKeys` stays `[]`, which is what the effective policy
 *     already reports for an org with no row (C3: the partner list is a
 *     CEILING, never an inherited grant). The key is appended afterwards, by
 *     the one writer allowed to do it.
 *
 * Two things `createAgent` does that this deliberately does NOT:
 *
 *   - `ensureManagedTriageAutomation`. The partner baseline's own managed
 *     automation already fires for every org beneath it, and the admission
 *     gate resolves the EFFECTIVE agent for the device's org (an org override
 *     wins over the managed baseline — see `automationRuntime.ts`'s
 *     `ai_triage` dispatch). Seeding a second, org-scoped automation would add
 *     a duplicate row to the customer's Automations list for a policy override
 *     they never asked to create.
 *   - `publishPolicyChanged`. The `ai.agent.policy_changed` event has no
 *     subscriber today (`agentService.ts`'s own TODO), and this executor has
 *     no `AuthContext` to attribute one with — the audit row below is the
 *     record of the change.
 *
 * A NOTE FOR REVIEWERS: cloning materializes the partner's CURRENT policy as
 * an org override, so from here on the org follows the partner only where the
 * merge is tighten-only (a partner that later NARROWS still wins; a partner
 * that later WIDENS does not reach this org). That is inherent to the plan's
 * "clone the effective policy" instruction — the alternative, a row of schema
 * defaults, would disable the agent outright — and is why the clone happens
 * only when no org row exists at all.
