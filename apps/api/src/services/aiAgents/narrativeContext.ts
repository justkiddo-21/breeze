/**
 * Bounded 7-day org context for a `narrative`-profile agent run (Phase 2
 * wave P2-3, weekly org narrative — task 5).
 *
 * ## Why the context is SYSTEM-BUILT
 *
 * A narrative run has an EMPTY tool floor: the model cannot drill into
 * anything. Every number it may write about is assembled here, by
 * hand-written org-pinned statements, and handed to it in one bounded
 * object. That makes the run reproducible (the same week produces the same
 * context) and keeps a weekly, unattended, customer-facing report from
 * becoming an open-ended read of the tenant's data. Same posture as
 * `sweepEvidence.ts`, one level up: there the model picks findings from a
 * fixed evidence set; here it writes prose over a fixed number set.
 *
 * ## The four properties this module holds
 *
 *  - **Numbers, closed labels, and operator-authored NAMES only.** Nothing
 *    a customer or an end user typed reaches the prompt: no alert message or
 *    title, no ticket subject or body, no sweep finding title/detail/
 *    evidence, no intent arguments/reason/result, no backup error log, no
 *    verdict rationale, no reliability raw JSON. The ONLY strings that cross
 *    are counts' labels (closed enums) and names an MSP operator chose —
 *    alert rule names, ticket category names, the org and partner names —
 *    each `\p{C}`-stripped and clamped through the shared
 *    `sanitizeSweepText` (see `sanitizeName`).
 *
 *  - **Every jsonb read is a closed whitelist.** `ai_agent_runs.outcome` is
 *    an open container, so its arrays are expanded only under a
 *    `jsonb_typeof(...) = 'array'` guard and every value that comes back is
 *    bucketed against a shared enum (`AI_SWEEP_KINDS`,
 *    `AI_SWEEP_SEVERITIES`, `SweepProposalDisposition`, `AgentRunVerdict`).
 *    A value that is not in the enum is DROPPED — never echoed into the
 *    prompt as a key of its own.
 *
 *  - **Honest availability.** "Measured zero" and "could not measure" are
 *    different facts and are reported differently: each block carries an
 *    `available` flag, and `unavailable` names every input that is missing.
 *    Two entries are always there because they are STRUCTURALLY
 *    unmeasurable: `alerts` has no `suppressed_at` (only a current-state
 *    suppressed count exists) and `devices` keeps no status history (so no
 *    online/offline delta can be derived — `fleet.deltaAvailable` is a
 *    `false` literal, not a maybe). A loader that REJECTS adds its block
 *    name; `Promise.allSettled` keeps one dead table from costing the whole
 *    narrative.
 *
 *  - **Bounded once, over the whole thing.** `NARRATIVE_TOP_N` caps the two
 *    variable-length lists (loaders fetch N+1 so the cap is OBSERVABLE —
 *    a bare `LIMIT N` would have Postgres discard the overflow before the
 *    assembler could see it, the bug fixed in `anomalyContext.ts`, #3828),
 *    and `NARRATIVE_CONTEXT_HARD_LIMIT_BYTES` is then enforced over
 *    `JSON.stringify` of the ENTIRE context (byte-based, like
 *    `anomalyContext.ts`), never per array. With every name clamped to 256
 *    chars the caps alone already keep the context near 8 KiB, so the byte
 *    ceiling is a backstop against future field growth rather than a
 *    routine event — which is exactly why `assembleNarrativeContext` takes
 *    an optional `limitBytes`: the trim ORDER has to stay provable.
 *
 * ## Tenancy
 *
 * `loadNarrativeContext` is called from the narrative run's context loader,
 * which already holds a SYSTEM DB context (full RLS bypass) — no context
 * management here, matching `loadSweepEvidence`/`loadAnomalyContext`. That
 * makes the org predicate in every statement below the ONLY thing keeping
 * one tenant's narrative out of another tenant's rows, so every statement
 * pins the org on its PRIMARY table AND on every tenant-bearing table it
 * joins.
 *
 * Two joins are partner-axis rather than org-axis, and both resolve the
 * partner from THIS org's row (never from the caller):
 *
 *  - an alert's rule owner is admitted only when the rule is this org's OR
 *    partner-wide for this org's partner (`org_id IS NULL AND partner_id =
 *    $partner`) — partner-wide alert rules are the norm for an MSP (epic
 *    #2135), so an org-only join would blank out most rule names;
 *  - `ticket_categories` is a partner-owned table with no `org_id` at all,
 *    so its join carries `c.partner_id = $partner`.
 *
 * When the header statement itself fails, `partnerId` stays `null` and both
 * clauses FAIL CLOSED (`partner_id = NULL` admits nothing), which is why the
 * header rejection is a reported `unavailable` entry rather than a throw.
 *
 * `assembleNarrativeContext` is the pure core (fixture-testable, no DB) that
 * `loadNarrativeContext` wraps with the actual reads.

/**
 * Load the previous 7 days of this org, bounded and honest.

 * The caller already holds a SYSTEM DB context — see this module's header on
 * tenancy. NEVER throws: a rejected loader costs exactly its own block.
 *
 * The header runs FIRST and alone because two joins downstream need its
 * `partner_id` and the period rendering needs its timezone. The remaining
 * seven then run one at a time, each isolated by `settled`.
 *
 * Sequential, not concurrent, and deliberately so: `withSystemDbAccessContext`
 * holds ONE pooled connection inside ONE open transaction for the whole call
 * (db/index.ts — the RLS GUCs are `SET LOCAL`), so issuing sixteen statements
 * at once would only queue them on that same connection. Same shape as
 * `loadSweepEvidence`'s per-kind loop.
 *
 * The limit of that isolation, stated plainly: because every statement shares
 * ONE transaction, a loader that fails with a genuine Postgres ERROR (rather
 * than a timeout or a dropped connection) aborts the transaction, and every
 * loader after it then fails too — `unavailable` will name several blocks
 * where only one is truly broken. Under-reporting availability is the safe
 * direction (the prompt renders "(not measured)"), and true statement-level
 * isolation would mean a savepoint round trip per loader for a failure mode
 * that means the schema is already broken.
