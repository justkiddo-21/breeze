/**
 * P2-5 (#4192, Task A2-6) — the DEMOTE executor, the mirror of
 * `supervisedKeyGrant.ts`.
 *
 * The one and only writer that REMOVES a colon key from an organization's
 * `ai_agents.actAssets.supervisedActionKeys`. Two AUTOMATIC events reach it,
 * and they are the two ways an unattended operation proves it should not have
 * been unattended:
 *
 *   - an ATTEMPTED failure of a released intent (`intentReleaseWorker.ts` —
 *     the terminal write stamped `executed_at`, so the provider-side call
 *     really happened and really failed);
 *   - a fix-watch `recurred` verdict (`fixWatch.ts` — the fix did not hold).
 *
 * A third caller is a HUMAN: `POST /ai/agents/graduation/revoke`
 * (`routes/aiAgents.ts`) with `reason: 'operator'`, the operator-facing
 * mirror of promote. It carries no `runId`/`watchId` — there is no
 * disqualifying evidence, only a decision — and it deliberately does NOT
 * notify (see `notifyDemotion`). Everything below applies to it unchanged
 * except the savepoint: the route holds no evidence transaction to nest in,
 * so it takes the `database` default and this executor opens its own system
 * context.
 *
 * Three properties make this safe to run unattended, and all three are the
 * reason it exists as its own module rather than as a second half of
 * `supervisedKeyGrant.ts`:
 *
 * 1. **ALWAYS ON.** Unlike the promote executor it never consults
 *    `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED`. Flipping the flag off stops
 *    new grants; it must never strand an existing one on an agent whose last
 *    attempt failed.
 *
 * 2. **It rides the transaction that recorded the negative evidence.** Both
 *    callers hand it the executor of a SAVEPOINT nested inside the
 *    transaction that just wrote the `failed` / `recurred` row, so on the
 *    happy path the revoke and the evidence that justifies it commit
 *    together, while a revoke failure rolls back to that savepoint and is
 *    Sentry-captured rather than unwinding a terminal state (an already-
 *    executed action in the release worker; a recurrence verdict a human
 *    needs to see in `fixWatch`). That is what
 *    the `database` parameter is for — the same shape `insertOpEvidence` and
 *    `createIntentFixWatchRow` already use, and for the same reason: a
 *    statement issued through the AMBIENT `db` proxy inside a savepoint goes
 *    to the OUTER scope, where postgres-js records its failure and rethrows
 *    it at scope end even if the caller caught it, aborting the terminal CAS
 *    of an action that already ran.
 *
 * 3. **Its import closure stays clean.** `fixWatch.ts` is the only real
 *    dependency of `fixWatchWorker`, a `global`-placement worker
 *    (`services/workerRegistry.ts`) that
 *    `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` forbids from reaching
 *    `routes/agentWs.ts` / `services/agentCommandAwait.ts`. Putting the
 *    revoke in `supervisedKeyGrant.ts` would import that whole graph into
 *    `fixWatch.ts`: the promote executor needs `agentService.withAgentRowLocked`,
 *    `agentService.ts` imports `actionIntents/policyDecidable`, and that
 *    reaches `aiTools.ts` and thence the route graph. Verified, not assumed —
 *    the same reasoning `graduationService.ts`'s header records for
 *    `policyDecidableKeys.ts`.
 *
 * Tenancy: the whole executor runs under a system context (the partner
 * baseline row is invisible to an org-scoped reader), so — per this repo's
 * invariant — every statement predicates on `org_id` / `partner_id`
 * explicitly even though RLS passes unconditionally there. `agentId` is never
 * trusted on its own: it is re-pinned through the organization's OWN partner
 * before it is allowed to name a `kind`.
 *
 * Leak rules: the audit row and the notification carry identifiers only —
 * the agent name, the op key, ids, a reason enum. Never a tool result, an
 * alert message, or any model-authored text.

 * Tells the agent's recipients that a key stopped running unattended.

 * `recipients` column is the PARTNER's and silently drops everyone an
 * organization added through its override), priority `high`, and the copy
 * names the agent and the op key and nothing else.
 *
 * MUST be called strictly AFTER the demote transaction commits — a
 * notification for a revoke that then rolls back is a false alarm an operator
 * cannot distinguish from a real one. Callers wrap it: a failure here is
 * logged, never allowed to unwind a committed revoke.
 *
 * **An unreadable run no longer suppresses the notice (#4582, spec §4.5 /
 * P2-5 Task 16).** The run's snapshot is the PREFERRED recipient source, not a
 * precondition: it is the policy the run actually executed under, so it names
 * exactly the people who were on the hook for the operation being graded. When
 * it cannot be read the fallback is the org's EFFECTIVE recipients — the
 * partner baseline's `recipients` merged with the org override's, through the
 * canonical `mergeAgentPolicies` so the union rule can never drift from the one
 * every other reader sees. The baseline row's own column alone would NOT do: it
 * is the PARTNER's list and silently drops everyone the organization added.
 *
 * The previous stand-down was the bug: the demote transaction has already
 * COMMITTED by the time this runs, so returning early leaves an organization
 * stripped of unattended authority with nobody told. An empty recipient set is
 * still a legitimate outcome; an unattempted resolution is not.
 *
 * Reachability, stated precisely because the dropped branch was justified as
 * unreachable once already: `runId === null` cannot be produced by either
 * caller today (`ai_agent_fix_watches.run_id` is NOT NULL, and the release
 * worker returns before building an input when `requesting_agent_run_id` is
 * absent), so that arm is a contract guarantee for this function's exported
 * `string | null` signature. The arm that IS reachable is a run row that no
 * longer resolves — `ai_agent_runs` is org-cascade registered, so an erasure
 * racing a fix-watch phase-2 job hits exactly this path.
 *
 * `resolveRecipientUserIds` re-derives live membership against THIS org in
 * either case, so the fallback cannot widen the audience beyond people who
 * currently have access to the org the notice describes.
 *
 * The three ways this can still end without a page — no agent row, no
 * resolvable recipient, a throw — are all Sentry-captured rather than logged
 * to a console nobody reads in production. A committed revoke that notifies
 * nobody must be visible however it happens; only the ROUTE differs from the
 * bug this closed.
