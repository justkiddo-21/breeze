/**
 * Phase 2 wave P2-4 (ticket triage, #4191) — Task A8. Turns the
 * `TicketTriageProposal` a `triage`-profile run produced
 * (`runLoop.ts`'s `finalizeTicketTriage`) into at most five gated, TICKET-SCOPED
 * `manage_tickets` action intents — `update_fields`, `link_device`, `comment`,
 * and up to two `draft` calls — plus a per-slot bookkeeping record the caller
 * logs. This module performs NO ticket writes of its own: every effect (the
 * CAS field update, the device link, the private note, the draft row) happens
 * later, when the minted intent actually RELEASES (either immediately, for a
 * creation-time `ticket_autonomy` grant, or after a human decides).
 *
 * Direct sibling of `sweepFindings.ts`'s `persistSweepFindings` (P2-2) and
 * `alertVerdicts.ts`'s `persistAlertVerdict` (P2-1) — read those files'
 * headers first. Same DB-context rules, same "never carry a raw
 * `Error.message` onto a persisted record" posture, same
 * `createActionIntent`-called-bare-outside-`inSystemDbContext` reasoning
 * (`alertVerdicts.ts`'s header has the long version).
 *
 * ## The five slots
 *
 * A proposal is turned into candidates in this FIXED order — deterministic
 * so a `maxActionsPerRun` cap always spends its budget the same way, and so
 * `idempotencyKey: triage:<runId>:<slot>` is stable across a redelivered
 * finalize call. `note` is spent FIRST (controller ruling, review round on
 * #4191 Task A8): spec §4.4 identifies the private note as THE triage
 * deliverable ("comment ... the triage summary. Exactly one per run") — an
 * agent whose cap is spent on optional field/link/draft candidates before
 * ever reaching the one guaranteed slot would silently drop the run's core
 * output. Reordering is safe precisely because idempotency keys are
 * slot-name-based (`triage:<runId>:note`, never a positional index) —
 * nothing about a redelivered finalize call depends on processing order.
 *
 *  1. `note` (`comment`) — ALWAYS attempted: `proposal.summary` is a
 *     required field on the schema, so there is always something to post as
 *     the run's one private note.
 *  2. `fields` (`update_fields`) — one field-patch intent covering every
 *     `TicketTriageFieldProposal` that (a) meets `TICKET_TRIAGE_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`
 *     and (b) is not already stamped `'user'` in the ticket's LIVE
 *     `field_provenance` (a human already touched it — never overwritten,
 *     never even offered for approval). Both are pre-filters only: the real
 *     CAS lives in `applyAiFieldUpdates` (`ticketService.ts`), re-checked
 *     against a FRESH read at execution time — this module's `human_set`
 *     skip exists so a human is never asked to approve a write that
 *     execution will silently no-op anyway. Skipped entirely (no intent)
 *     when nothing survives both filters.
 *  3. `link` (`link_device`) — only when the proposal named a device
 *     (`hostname` and/or `serial`) AND the ticket does not already have one.
 *     Single-match resolution happens at EXECUTION, never here — the intent
 *     carries identifiers, not a resolved id (spec §4.4).
 *  4. `draft-reply` (`draft`, `kind: 'reply'`) — attempted whenever the
 *     model proposed one; never gated on ticket state (a reply draft can
 *     always be queued for a human "Send as me" decision).
 *  5. `draft-resolution` (`draft`, `kind: 'resolution_note'`) — attempted
 *     only when the model proposed one AND the ticket's LIVE
 *     `resolution_note` is still empty (a human already wrote one — the
 *     model's draft would just be noise).
 *
 * Every candidate that survives its own gate is still subject to the run's
 * `maxActionsPerRun` cap, spent in the slot order above.
 *
 * ## Creation-time autonomy is decided ONCE, cheaply, in advance
 *
 * `determineAutonomyAdvisory` below is a CHEAP, ADVISORY duplicate of the
 * five gates `ticketAutonomy.ts`'s `evaluateTicketAutonomy` re-checks
 * INSIDE `createActionIntent`'s own transaction — that function is
 * intentionally internal to `intentService`/`ticketAutonomy.ts` and is never
 * imported here. This module only has to decide whether it is worth ASKING
 * for autonomy at all (`autonomy: { kind: 'ticket_autonomy' } | undefined`,
 * passed identically to every one of this run's intent creations); the real,
 * authoritative decision is made per-intent by the hook itself, which is why
 * a false-positive advisory result is harmless (the hook simply denies and
 * the intent falls back to `human_required`) while a false negative merely
 * costs an unnecessary human approval — never a security gap either way.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: `autonomous` is a single call-level flag — it says whether
 * autonomy was REQUESTED uniformly, not whether it was GRANTED for every
 * intent. The live gates inside `createActionIntent` can legitimately flip
 * between two sequential calls within the same `persistTicketTriage`
 * invocation (a kill-switch trip, a policy edit mid-loop), so the caller
 * must never treat `autonomous` as a proxy for "every created intent is
 * `approved`". `approvedIntentIds` below is the ground-truth signal:
 * populated per-intent from that intent's OWN returned `status`, never from
 * the advisory flag (review fix, #4191 Task A8 round 2).
 *
 * Mirrors gates 2-4 of `evaluateTicketAutonomy` (gate 1 — "was autonomy
 * requested" — and gate 5 — "is the scope a ticket" — are trivially true
 * here, since this module always requests it for an already ticket-scoped
 * run when the snapshot passes): the run's own immutable
 * `policySnapshot.effective` must already carry `mode: 'act'` +
 * `triggers.ticketAutonomousWrites: true` (cheap, synchronous — checked
 * FIRST so the common "not an autonomous agent" case never pays for a live
 * read), then the LIVE effective policy for the SAME agent identity must
 * also carry both, then the kill switch must not be engaged. ANY read
 * failure (a missing org, a thrown error) denies — this function must never
 * throw, and a denial here always means "proceed down the ordinary
 * `human_required` path", never a lost proposal.
