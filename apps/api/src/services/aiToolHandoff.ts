/**
 * Approval-handoff tool outcomes — the API half of the contract (#5107).
 *
 * The WIRE literal and its predicate live in `@breeze/shared`
 * (`utils/aiToolHandoff.ts`) because the web client renders them too; this
 * module adds only what is API-side (the text the model reads) and re-exports
 * the rest so the SDK files have one import. Keep it otherwise a LEAF — no
 * schema, no db, no service imports: the SDK suites mock `../db/schema`
 * partially and widening this graph breaks them with "No <x> export is defined
 * on the mock". (`@breeze/shared` is exempt: it carries no db/schema, and
 * `aiAgentSdkTools.ts` already pulls the same barrel.)
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * When a human approves a tier-3 action intent, the live chat session is NOT
 * always the side that executes it: the durable release worker
 * (`jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts`) also consumes the `intent_approved` outbox
 * and races the session for the `approved -> executing` CAS. Two exits in
 * `createSessionPreToolUse` therefore hand the action off to that worker:
 *
 *   1. the tool is in `DURABLE_RELEASE_ONLY_TOOLS`, so the session declines
 *      the CAS on purpose, and
 *   2. the session attempted the CAS and LOST it to the worker.
 *
 * Both used to be reported to the model and the UI as `{ error: ... }` with
 * `isError: true`, so a user who had just approved on their phone read
 * `MANAGE_SERVICES · FAILED` in deny-red. That is not a failure: the action is
 * authorized and running, just somewhere else.
 *
 * These outcomes carry `status: 'approved_executing'` and are published with
 * `isError: false`. Clients switch on the STATUS FIELD — never on the message
 * text — so this stays a machine-readable contract rather than a string sniff.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a success either: the action has not completed and
 * this session will never observe its outcome (a completion event from the
 * worker back into the session is tracked separately, see #5107's out-of-scope
 * note). Anything that records a terminal result must therefore say which of
 * the two it is — see the audit event in `aiAgentSdk.ts`'s postToolUse, which
 * stamps `toolOutcome: 'approved_executing'` instead of claiming the tool ran.

// Package ROOT, not `@breeze/shared/utils/aiToolHandoff`. The deep subpath is
// absent from packages/shared's `exports` map, so Node refuses to resolve it —
// and this is a VALUE import, which is why it fails at runtime rather than
// being erased the way the neighbouring `import type ... from
// '@breeze/shared/types/ai'` deep paths are. The unit job resolves the package
// from source and never noticed; the integration config goes through the
// exports map and three suites died at module load.
