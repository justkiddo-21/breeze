 * numbers must be the same constant the web wizard chunks against, and
 * `packages/shared` carries no db/service/schema code of its own, so it does
 * not reintroduce the import cycle this rule exists to prevent. Otherwise this
 * module imports nothing — not the db, not a service, not a schema — so W07's
 * definition importer and W08's value importer can both depend on it without
 * an import cycle. Everything else here is either a type (erased at compile
 * time) or a frozen literal list. Never add another runtime import to this
 * file; put the code in the service module that needs it.
 *
 * Created in W06 and extended by W07/W08 — the row and outcome vocabulary is
 * shared across every stage of the pipeline.
