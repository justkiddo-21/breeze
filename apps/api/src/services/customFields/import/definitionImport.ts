/**
 * Custom-field DEFINITION import pipeline: preview -> commit (#3257 W07).
 *
 * Named `customFieldDefinitionImport`, never `customFieldImport`: `tickets.
 * custom_fields` (`db/schema/portal.ts`) and the PSA/Jira `customFields`
 * (`services/psa/jira.ts`) are unrelated namesakes already in the tree, and the
 * VALUES importer (W08) is a different pipeline with different tenancy.
 *
 * Modelled on `services/contacts/import.ts`: preview annotates every row
 * against a snapshot; commit RE-DERIVES every annotation against freshly loaded
 * state and refuses any row whose annotation moved, with identity pinning on
 * the matched definition. Preview is advisory; the database is authority.
 *
 * ── What the annotations encode ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The destination was hardened before this importer shipped, and preview must
 * report that reality rather than a guess:
 *
 *  - W02 gave `custom_field_definitions` a per-axis unique index, so a
 *    same-axis re-import is `already-exists` (skipped), not a second row.
 *  - W02's `custom_field_definitions_one_owner_chk` makes ownership org XOR
 *    partner, so `ownerScope` is the row's whole ownership story.
 *  - W03's `custom_field_definitions_no_shadow` trigger forbids the same
 *    `field_key` on both axes under one partner, so a cross-axis collision is
 *    `key-shadowed` at preview instead of a P0001 nobody expected at commit.
 *
 * ── Where the snapshot comes from, and why it is a system read ──────────────
 * Historically `custom_field_definitions` had NO partner-wide SELECT branch on
 * its RLS policy (it was the last entry in
 * `PARTNER_WIDE_SELECT_BRANCH_EXEMPT`, `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts`), so
 * an ORGANIZATION-scoped request context could not see partner-wide rows at
 * all and reading the snapshot in the request context would have annotated a
 * shadowed key as `create` for exactly the callers most likely to hit it.
 * #4944 (`custom_field_definitions_partner_wide_select`) closed that half: an
 * org context now reads its OWN partner's partner-wide rows.
 *
 * The system read stays anyway, and its remaining reason is the OTHER half —
 * this importer is a PARTNER-scoped operation that legitimately spans MANY of
 * that partner's organizations, and no single request context can see another
 * org's rows. The snapshot is loaded in ONE system context, bounded by
 * `ctx.partnerId` AND `ctx.accessibleOrgIds` — the same reasoning, and the same
 * bound, as `contacts/import.ts:229`.
 *
 * Because that read has no RLS backstop, the app-layer bound is the WHOLE
 * boundary on it: a row naming an organization absent from the snapshot is
 * refused as `org-not-found`, the same annotation an unreachable org gets, so
 * the response is never an existence oracle.
 *
 * ── Where the WRITES happen, and why that is different ──────────────────────
 * Writes deliberately do NOT escape to a system context. Each row's insert runs
 * in a NESTED `db.transaction` inside the request's own `withDbAccessContext`
 * transaction, which drizzle emits as a SAVEPOINT
 * (`dbSavepointErrorIsolation.integration.test.ts` is the proof). That buys the
 * per-row failure isolation an importer needs — a failed statement would
 * otherwise abort the request transaction and every later row would raise
 * 25P02 — while keeping RLS as a real second control on every write. The
 * failing statement MUST be issued on the nested callback's `tx`, never on the
 * ambient `db` proxy, or the error is recorded against the OUTER scope and the
 * isolation is lost.
