 * SYSTEM context, deliberately — and, since #4944, REDUNDANT rather than

 *
 * `custom_field_definitions` is dual-axis (org OR partner). Every caller of
 * this function — the script write-back path's `runWithAgentOrgDbAccess`
 * context, and the two device-PATCH write paths' ordinary org-scoped request
 * context — sets accessiblePartnerIds: [], so
 * `breeze_has_partner_access(partner_id)` is false. Until
 * `2026-10-13-110000-custom-field-definitions-partner-wide-select.sql` that
 * made every partner-wide definition (org_id IS NULL) INVISIBLE from these
 * paths, and a partner that defined one field for all its orgs would silently
 * have no fields visible from any of them (CLAUDE.md, Partner-Wide First §3).
 *
 * That branch — `org_id IS NULL AND partner_id =
 * public.breeze_current_partner_id()`, SELECT only — now covers exactly these
 * callers: `buildDbAccessContext` populates `currentPartnerId` for org scope,
 * and `middleware/agentAuth.ts` sets it to `device.partnerId` for the agent
 * path (#4673 W02). The escalation below therefore buys nothing an ordinary
 * request-context read would not already return, and it costs a SECOND pooled
 * connection held under the request's own transaction (#1105). It is kept only
 * so that removing it is a deliberate, separately-verified change rather than a
 * side effect of the migration; do not treat this comment as a claim that RLS
 * still hides these rows.
 *
 * `runOutsideDbContext(() => withSystemDbAccessContext(...))` is the only form
 * that genuinely opens a second context — a bare nested
 * `withSystemDbAccessContext` early-returns and runs under the ORG context
 * instead. The scope is app-layer: an explicit org/partner predicate, kept
 * narrow, and the context is released immediately (it holds a second pooled
 * connection for its duration — #1105). This now runs on every custom-field
 * PATCH, not just script write-back — if this becomes a per-request cost
 * worth caring about, cache the definition set per org/request rather than
 * re-querying it per PATCH.

/**
 * Upsert device custom-field values into `device_custom_field_values`

 *
 * `devices.custom_fields` is no longer written by any caller — it is rebuilt by
 * `breeze_device_custom_field_project()` from this table. Writing it directly
 * would be overwritten by the next value write, and would bypass both the
 * composite device/org FK and the definition coherence trigger.
 *
 * Ambient ORG context. `org_id` pins the write to the org the transport
 * authorized (RLS enforces it too — the predicate is defense in depth, the same
 * shape `routes/devices/customFieldValues.ts` already applies).
 *
 * THE COMPARE-BEFORE-WRITE IS NOT COSMETIC, and it moved here from
 * `scriptWriteBack.ts` so all three write paths get it. An UPDATE that actually
 * changes a value propagates through the projection trigger to an UPDATE on
 * `devices`, which fires `breeze_partner_export_z_custom_values_update` and
 * takes `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1000201, hashtext(org_id))` — an EXCLUSIVE
 * per-org lock held to COMMIT. A fleet-wide script re-writing unchanged values
 * would serialise every device in the org behind it. `setWhere` makes Postgres
 * skip the UPDATE entirely (no RETURNING row, no WAL, no trigger) rather than
 * making us read-then-write.
 *
 * `source` is deliberately NOT part of that predicate, so re-asserting the same
 * value from a different writer leaves the original `source` in place. That is a
 * conscious trade: adding it would make provenance track the last writer, but it
 * would also mean a fleet-wide script re-asserting unchanged values updates
 * every row again — WAL and a row lock per device — which is the exact cost this
 * comparison exists to avoid. Provenance is informational; the write amplification
 * is not. Do not "fix" this without that trade in front of you.
 *
 * `executor` defaults to the ambient `db` proxy, which is what every request
 * path wants. The RMM value importer (#3257 W08) passes the handle of its
 * PER-ROW nested transaction instead: a statement issued on the ambient proxy
 * from inside a nested transaction still resolves to the OUTER request
 * transaction, so a failure is recorded against the outer postgres.js scope and
 * poisons the whole request instead of rolling back to that row's savepoint
 * (`dbSavepointErrorIsolation.integration.test.ts` is the proof). The parameter
 * exists so the importer gets per-row failure isolation WITHOUT forking this
 * upsert — the compare-before-write `setWhere` below is subtle and load-bearing,
 * and a second copy of it would drift.
