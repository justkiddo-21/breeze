/**
 * Multi-currency §11 freeze (Phase C, Task 3 — accountingCurrency.ts:143-186).
 *
 * `AccountingProvider.pushInvoice`/`voidInvoice`/`createPayment`/`deletePayment`
 * must only ever be reached through `accountingInvoicePush.ts`'s guarded
 * coordinator (`pushInvoiceToAccounting` / `voidInvoiceInAccounting`), which runs
 * the currency guard (`assertAccountingInvoicePushCurrency`) and every mapping
 * write BEFORE the provider call. A second call site anywhere else in the
 * image would bypass that guard entirely — this test pins the invariant the
 * same way `stripeCheckoutCallSites.test.ts` pins Stripe's currency mapper: an
 * AST scan, not a grep, because a textual count is satisfied by an unused
 * import and a per-FILE count misses a second call added to a file that
 * already has one.
 *
 * SCOPE: `apps/api/src` is not the whole API image. `ee/` holds first-party
 * extensions compiled into that image and loaded at boot behind an enable
 * flag, so an unguarded call there would bypass the guard exactly like one
 * added under `src/`. Both trees are scanned, paths keyed from the REPO ROOT.
 *
 * Test files are excluded entirely (mirrors the Stripe gate): a mocked
 * provider's `.pushInvoice`/`.voidInvoice` in a unit test is a property access
 * on a mock object, not a call the guard needs to police, and
 * `quickbooksProvider.test.ts` legitimately calls the transport methods
 * directly to test the transport itself.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION: matching is syntactic (an aliased/rebound reference to
 * `provider.pushInvoice` would not be caught) — the same limitation the
 * Stripe gate documents and accepts for the same reason: real alias
 * resolution needs a type-checked program over both trees, disproportionate
 * for a freeze test.
