/**
 * The ONE sanctioned entry to `AccountingProvider.createPayment`/`deletePayment`
 * (Phase D2 — docs/superpowers/specs/billing/2026-09-02-quickbooks-phase-d2-payment-push-design.md).
 *
 * THE MAPPING ROW IS THE OUTBOX (spec decision 1). `requestPaymentPush` /
 * `requestPaymentDelete` run INSIDE the caller's already-locked payment
 * transaction and write `pending_op`; the BullMQ enqueue that follows is only a
 * latency optimisation. A lost enqueue — Redis down, the process dying between
 * commit and `add()`, a savepoint not yet committed — is recovered by the
 * 15-minute reconcile sweep, which re-enqueues every stale `pending_op` row. The
 * mapping is NEVER cleared until QuickBooks confirms, so a delete cannot be lost
 * even after BullMQ exhausts its attempts. That is also why
 * `requestPaymentDelete` never DELETES a Breeze-origin row, not even one whose
 * push has not recorded a remote id yet: the create may be in flight at that
 * exact moment, and a deleted mapping row cannot be recreated afterwards — the
 * `accounting_entity_mappings_entity_partner_guard` trigger refuses an INSERT
 * whose `invoice_payments` row no longer exists. Flipping the row to
 * `pending_op = 'delete'` instead keeps a durable place for phase 2 to stamp the
 * remote ref it is about to learn.
 *
 * EXCLUSIVE CLAIM BY LEASE (spec decision 2). A worker claims a row with a
 * compare-and-set — `SET claimed_at = now() WHERE id = ? AND pending_op = ? AND
 * (claimed_at IS NULL OR claimed_at < now() - 10 min)`. Zero rows means somebody
 * else holds it: `sync_in_progress`, retryable. The Phase C upsert idiom is not
 * enough here because it only excludes racing INSERTs, and a payment row can be
 * re-entered by the sweep while a webhook-triggered job is still running.
 *
 * THIS MODULE NEVER TOUCHES REDIS. Every function returns the mapping ids that
 * are owed an enqueue and lets the CALLER do the `add()` after its transaction
 * returns. That keeps BullMQ out of `invoiceService`'s locked transactions, out
 * of this module's unit tests, and out of any code path holding a row lock.
 *
 * DB ACCESS CONTRACT (verbatim from `accountingInvoicePush.ts`, the Phase-C
 * coordinator this module mirrors). `pushPaymentToAccounting` /
 * `deletePaymentInAccounting` MUST be entered with NO ambient DB access context
 * (asserted) and take a `runInDbContext` runner instead. Each DB phase is one
 * SHORT invocation of that runner — a real transaction that commits on its own —
 * and no context is ever open across a QuickBooks call:
 *
 *   Phase 1  lease CAS, connection, payment + invoice, mappings, currency guard,
 *            payload build                                          [COMMITS]
 *   ─ token resolution, then the QBO create/delete — nothing held ─
 *   Phase 2  invoice FOR UPDATE, re-read, stamp / convert / diverge  [COMMITS]
 *
 * The split is load-bearing. Held inside ONE caller-opened transaction, every
 * write that records a FAILURE would be a savepoint that rolls back the instant
 * this coordinator throws: the operator sees no error at all, the lease is never
 * released, and a pooled Postgres connection sits idle-in-transaction across the
 * whole QuickBooks round trip (#1105). Phase 1 exploits the same property in the
 * OTHER direction — a typed refusal that must NOT be recorded simply throws, and
 * the rolled-back transaction un-claims the lease for free; a refusal that MUST
 * be recorded returns a value so its write commits, and the throw happens after
 * the runner returns.

/**
 * A Breeze payment row is about to be destroyed — do the right thing with its
 * accounting mapping. The single destroyer-side helper (it REPLACES Phase D's
 * `clearPaymentMappingForInvoicePayment`, which only ever deleted the row).
 *
 * Called by `invoiceService.voidPayment` and `stripeReconcile`'s full-refund
 * branch, BEFORE the `invoice_payments` delete, inside the transaction that
 * already holds the invoice lock. `breeze_entity_id` is polymorphic, so there is
 * no FK to cascade: without this call the mapping outlives its payment and a
 * later CDC delivery for the same QuickBooks Payment reads as "already applied"
 * and silently skips.
 *
 * Four cases:
 *  - Breeze-origin that QuickBooks can be told about — it has a remote id, or a
 *    `pending_op` meaning a create is owed or in flight -> keep the row, flip
 *    `pending_op='delete'`. Breeze created that Payment in QuickBooks — or is
 *    creating it right now — so Breeze owns its removal, regardless of
 *    `push_mode` or `push_payments` (spec decision 10).
 *  - Breeze-origin RETIRED as `terminal_reason = 'orphaned'` -> keep the row and
 *    audit the retention. Shape-identical to the stranded case below and the
 *    opposite in meaning; see the fifth-state paragraph.
 *  - Breeze-origin STRANDED — `remote_entity_id IS NULL` AND `pending_op IS
 *    NULL` -> delete the row (see the exception below).
 *  - QuickBooks-origin -> delete the row, as Phase D always did. The pull's
 *    reversal path owns those; asking QuickBooks to delete its own payment
 *    because Breeze voided a mirror of it would be backwards.
 *
 * WHY A PUSH-PENDING ROW WITH NO REMOTE ID IS KEPT, NOT DELETED. It is tempting
 * to drop it — "nothing exists in QuickBooks yet" — but that is only true if no
 * create is in flight, and this helper runs at exactly the moment one might be:
 * a worker can sit between its phase 1 and its QuickBooks call. Deleting the row
 * there orphans a real QuickBooks Payment, because phase 2 then finds no row to
 * stamp and CANNOT recreate one — the
 * `accounting_entity_mappings_entity_partner_guard` trigger rejects an INSERT
 * whose `invoice_payments` row is already gone. Flipping to `delete` instead
 * leaves phase 2 somewhere to record the remote ref it is about to learn, and
 * the delete worker parks the row until then
 * (`awaiting_remote_ref`/`PAYMENT_DELETE_UNRESOLVED_GRACE_MS`).
 *
 * `claimed_at` is deliberately left ALONE for the same reason: a live lease
 * means a worker is mid-flight, and clearing it would invite a SECOND worker to
 * start a second create for the same payment. The delete worker gets a clean
 * `sync_in_progress` while the lease is live and retries.
 *
 * The UPDATE touches no column the partner-guard trigger watches
 * (`partner_id`, `breeze_entity_type`, `breeze_entity_id`), so it stays legal
 * even as the `invoice_payments` row disappears in the same transaction.
 *
 * THE STRANDED EXCEPTION (final-review finding C2). A row with
 * `remote_entity_id IS NULL` AND `pending_op IS NULL` is not addressable in
 * QuickBooks and nothing is coming to make it so. No create is in flight — an
 * in-flight create's row still owes a `push` — so the paragraph above does not
 * apply, and flipping it to `delete` would park the delete worker
 * on `awaiting_remote_ref` for 24 hours and then raise a false
 * "a QuickBooks Payment may be orphaned" Sentry alarm for a Payment that was
 * never created. The row is DELETED instead, and nothing new is audited — the
 * caller's own void/refund audit already records the event.
 *
 * Four states reach that shape, all of them terminal states of the push:
 *  - a true deletion of the QuickBooks Payment that the pull mirrored back
 *    (`breeze_origin_removed_remotely` clears the ids and leaves nothing owed,
 *    waiting for a fan-out re-own that never came);
 *  - `push_disabled` — the connection's `push_payments` was switched off;
 *  - a pre-call terminal refusal — `invoice_void`, `customer_not_mapped`, a
 *    currency-contract failure, or a push row that burned through
 *    `PAYMENT_PUSH_MAX_ATTEMPTS`;
 *
 * `record_failed` — QuickBooks accepted a create whose result Breeze could not
 * record — does NOT reach that shape while it is still retrying (review finding
 * 1): it keeps `pending_op = 'push'`, so this helper flips it to `delete` like
 * any other in-flight create and the orphaned Payment stays adoptable by its
 * `PrivateNote` marker until the delete worker or the CDC pull resolves it.
 *
 * A RETIRED one does reach it, and is the fifth state — the one exception to
 * the paragraph above (review wave 3, finding D7). Once
 * `PAYMENT_RECORD_FAILED_MAX_SWEEPS` is spent the row carries
 * `PAYMENT_RECORD_FAILED_ORPHAN_MESSAGE` with nothing owed and no remote id,
 * which is byte-identical to "stranded" but means the OPPOSITE: QuickBooks
 * holds a Payment nobody can name. Deleting it would erase the only record that
 * the orphan exists — silently, on an ordinary void. The row is KEPT exactly as
 * it is (nothing owed, nothing started: there is no remote id to delete with)
 * and the retention is audited, so the mapping card and the audit trail both
 * still lead a human to it.
 *
 * Returns the mapping id to enqueue a `delete-payment` job for, or `null`.
 * Zero rows is LEGITIMATE and deliberately not a throw: a manual or Stripe
 * payment usually has no accounting mapping at all.

 * `record_failed_count` (see `PAYMENT_RECORD_FAILED_MAX_SWEEPS`), because that
 * path must stop inside Intuit's 24-hour requestid replay window and this
 * ceiling is ~25 hours for it. `pending_op`
 * is never cleared on a retryable failure — that is what makes the outbox
 * durable — so nothing else stops the 15-minute sweep re-enqueueing a row
 * forever. `sync_attempts` is incremented IN THE UPDATE (never read-modify-write:
 * the sweep and an immediate enqueue can both be mid-flight on one row) and a
 * `push` row that reaches `PAYMENT_PUSH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` gives up here: `pending_op`
 * and the lease are cleared and `last_error` says so, quoting the failure that
 * did it. The invoice fan-out's re-own is the documented recovery, and it resets
 * the counter.
 *
 * A `delete` row is NEVER capped and NEVER dropped. Once Breeze created a
 * Payment in QuickBooks it owns that removal, and giving up would strand money
 * in someone's books; the row keeps asking until QuickBooks confirms (or the
 * pull observes the deletion and satisfies it). The counter still earns its keep
 * there — it is what throttles the delete path's Sentry reporting.
 *
 * `countAttempt: 'never'` stamps the reason but touches neither the counter nor
 * the ceiling. Only the not-connected skip uses it (review finding 6). A skip is
 * not an attempt at anything: nothing reached QuickBooks, and the fix is an
 * operator reconnect. Counting it retired EVERY pending push after a reauth
 * outage of about 25 hours (one skip per 15-minute sweep against a 100-attempt
 * ceiling) — and the give-up clears `pending_op`, so the reconnect the operator
 * finally performed could no longer complete them. For a `delete` row the same
 * setting protects its Sentry throttle: its count is the ONLY one, so a
 * disconnected realm inflating it would mean the first genuine failure after the
 * reconnect landed mid-cycle and raised nothing.
 *
 * Returns the row's NEW attempt count (unchanged under `countAttempt: 'never'`),
 * or null when no row matched. Zero rows is tolerated for the same
 * reason as `releaseLease` above: this is best-effort annotation of a failure
 * that is being reported anyway, and Sentry already carries the original.
