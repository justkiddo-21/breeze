/**
 * The QuickBooks -> Breeze payment applier (Phase D, Task 3 —
 * .superpowers/sdd/2026-09-02-quickbooks-phase-d-payment-pullback/task-3-brief.md).
 *
 * Consumes one `ChangeSetPaymentLine` produced by `reconcileChanges` (Task 2)
 * and lands it as an `invoice_payments` row plus the `accounting_entity_mappings`
 * row that claims it, at most once. Also mirrors QBO-side deletions
 * (`reverseAccountingPayment`, `markInvoiceDeletedRemotely`).
 *
 * The mapping-row cleanup the two Breeze-side payment destroyers must perform
 * moved OUT of this module in Phase D2: `requestPaymentDelete`
 * (`accountingPaymentPush.ts`) replaced `clearPaymentMappingForInvoicePayment`,
 * because a Breeze-origin mapping with a remote id must now be KEPT and flipped
 * to `pending_op = 'delete'` until QuickBooks confirms the removal, not deleted
 * outright.
 *
 * DB ACCESS CONTRACT (verbatim from `accountingInvoicePush.ts`, the Phase-C
 * coordinator this module mirrors). Every entry point here MUST be entered with
 * NO ambient DB access context (asserted) and takes a `runInDbContext` runner
 * instead: routes pass `(fn) => withAuthDbAccessContext(auth, fn)`, the worker
 * passes `(fn) => withSystemDbAccessContext(fn, 'accountingSync.<type>')`. Each
 * DB phase is one SHORT invocation of that runner, i.e. a real transaction that
 * commits on its own, and no context is ever open across a QuickBooks call.
 *
 * The split is load-bearing, not hygiene. `withDbAccessContext` opens ONE real
 * transaction and holds it for the whole callback; a nested
 * `withSystemDbAccessContext` JOINS it and a nested `db.transaction` degrades to
 * a SAVEPOINT. Held inside ONE caller-opened transaction, every write this
 * module makes to record a FAILURE (a `sync_status='error'` marker) would be a
 * savepoint that rolls back the instant the caller throws: the operator would
 * see no error at all, and a pooled Postgres connection would sit
 * idle-in-transaction across the whole QuickBooks round trip (#1105).
 *
 * This module itself makes NO QuickBooks HTTP call — the CDC read already
 * happened in `reconcileChanges` and the caller hands us the parsed line. The
 * guard is still asserted because the applier is invoked from the same worker
 * loop that DOES make those calls, and it is the loop's context discipline the
 * assert protects.
 *
 * LOCK ORDER is prescribed by `accountingCurrency.ts`'s trailing contract
 * comment, item 4 ("A payment applier that follows the ESTABLISHED INVOICE-FIRST
 * LOCK ORDER"), which in turn points at `invoiceService.recordPayment`
 * ("ONE transaction, invoice row lock FIRST") and is mirrored by
 * `stripeReconcile.recordStripePayment`. Concretely, inside ONE transaction:
 *
 *   a. unlocked discovery read of the invoice mapping — resolves WHICH invoice
 *      to lock; NOT authoritative (mirrors recordStripePayment's own comment);
 *   b. `SELECT ... FROM invoices ... FOR UPDATE`;
 *   c. the payment mapping re-read UNDER that lock — the authoritative
 *      at-most-once claim;
 *   d. `normalizeAccountingPayment` against the LOCKED invoice's stamped
 *      currency (equality asserted before any minor-unit conversion);
 *   e/f. the `invoice_payments` write and `recomputeInvoiceStatus(inv.id, db)`,
 *      which re-reads the payment sum inside the same transaction and therefore
 *      under the same lock.
 *
 * DELIBERATE DEPARTURES FROM THE MANUAL PAYMENT PATH:
 *
 *  0. A VOID INVOICE IS REFUSED, like `recordPayment` refuses one — but as the
 *     clean `invoice_void` outcome plus an invoice-mapping error marker rather
 *     than a throw, because there is no caller to show a 409 to and a throw
 *     would pin the CDC cursor forever on a document that will never accept the
 *     payment.
 *  1. OVER-PAYMENT IS ALLOWED (plan decision 2). `recordPayment` rejects a
 *     payment that exceeds the balance because a human typed it; here
 *     QuickBooks is reporting money that already moved, and refusing it would
 *     leave Breeze permanently disagreeing with the ledger. That is why this
 *     module writes `invoice_payments` directly and never through
 *     `recordPayment`.
 *  2. A CURRENCY MISMATCH IS RECORDED ON THE **INVOICE** MAPPING ROW, not on a
 *     payment mapping row. `accounting_entity_mappings` carries an ownership
 *     trigger (`validate_accounting_mapping_entity_partner`,
 *     2026-09-28-quickbooks-entity-mappings.sql) whose `payment` arm requires
 *     `breeze_entity_id` to be an EXISTING `invoice_payments` id under the same
 *     partner. A mismatch produces no payment row, so there is no id to point
 *     at and a payment mapping row is structurally impossible. The invoice
 *     mapping row is the durable, operator-visible surface for the failure —
 *     the same row `markInvoiceDeletedRemotely` marks.
