/**
 * Observability for the action-intents durable approval layer (spec
 * docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-07-18-action-intents-approval-layer-design.md
 * §7). Pattern-matches
 * services/m365ControlPlane/readActionMetrics.ts: a settable recorder behind
 * a Prometheus counter, plus an audit-event helper that fires both from one
 * call so every call site only has to remember one function.
 *
 * `ActionIntentOutcome` is deliberately restricted to the exact seven audit
 * actions the design spec names (§7) — `created`, `approved`, `rejected`,
 * `expired`, `cancelled`, `executed`, `self_approved_sole_operator` — so the
 * emitted `action_intent.<outcome>` audit action string is always one of
 * those seven. Finer-grained detail (e.g. WHY a cancellation happened, such
 * as `no_eligible_approvers`) belongs in `details.errorCode`, never a new
 * outcome value — keeps the metrics cardinality and the audit vocabulary
 * both bounded and matching the spec exactly.
 *
 * `digest_mismatch` and `approver_unauthorized` are the two deliberate
 * additions beyond the spec's seven: both are decide-time security refusals in
 * the decide handler (routes/approvals.ts) that reject a decision WITHOUT ever
 * calling `transitionIntent`, so none of the seven lifecycle outcomes fit.
 * `digest_mismatch` fires on the tamper-detection tripwire
 * (`existing.boundArgumentDigest !== linkedIntent.argumentDigest`);
 * `approver_unauthorized` fires when the deciding user no longer holds
 * approvals:decide / org access at decide time (a demoted approver reusing a
 * still-visible fanned-out row), and — per the "WHY belongs in
 * details.errorCode" rule above — ALSO carries the sole-operator
 * re-derivation refusal (#2685) as `details.errorCode:
 * 'not_sole_approver'`: a requester self-approving an intent whose org now
 * has another eligible approver. Both are failure outcomes (see
 * `FAILURE_OUTCOMES`).
 *
 * `effect_digest_unpinned` is the third addition beyond the spec's seven, and
 * the only NON-failure one. It fires at CREATION time (intentService.ts) when
 * services/actionIntents/effectDigest.ts had a resolver for the tool/action
 * but produced nothing to pin — the id argument was missing/non-string, or
 * the target row was absent/soft-deleted. Those intents store
 * `effect_digest = NULL`, which is byte-identical to the entirely expected
 * "this tool has no resolver at all" case, so without this event they are
 * unobservable: nothing can count or alert on a surface that quietly stopped
 * being pinnable. The WHICH-of-the-two lives in `details.reason`
 * (`missing_arg` | `target_absent`), per the "WHY belongs in details" rule
 * above. NOT a failure outcome — creation succeeded and the intent is
 * perfectly valid; it is simply un-TOCTOU-protected, which is a
 * coverage signal, not an error.

   * Emitted by the PRE-execution loss sites in services/aiAgentSdk.ts, where
   * the tool never ran: nothing is wrong with the intent, so it is neither a
   * failure of the action nor Sentry-worthy (contention here is expected),
