/**
 * Explicit reads of ARCHIVED organizations (org-lifecycle Wave 4, Task 3).
 *
 * Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/tenancy-rls/2026-08-26-org-lifecycle-merge-archive-design.md
 * (Part 2, "Hidden + read-only").
 *
 * `archived` orgs — and, since #4166, orgs mid-ARCHIVE-drain (`offboarding`
 * with `offboarding_target = 'archive'`) — are excluded from
 * `computeAccessibleOrgIds` (`status IN ('active','trial')`), so a request's own
 * RLS context cannot see them at all — by design. These helpers are the
 * explicit, opt-in door, and they are the only place in the org routes that
 * opens `withArchivedOrgReadContext`. `archiveLifecycleCondition` below is the
 * single definition of which states the door admits, and why.
 *
 * Two phases, on purpose:
 *
 *  1. **Discovery** — a minimal `id`-only SELECT under a system context,
 *     hard-pinned to the caller's VERIFIED partner id (never client input). The
 *     archived read context takes an explicit id allowlist, so something has to
 *     resolve "which archived orgs does this partner have" first, and nothing
 *     but a system context can see those rows.
 *  2. **Serving** — the actual row read runs under
 *     `withArchivedOrgReadContext`, whose transaction is `READ ONLY`. The
 *     system context above is read-WRITE, so serving full rows from it would
 *     hand callers exactly the capability Part 2 exists to withhold.
 *
 * Both phases run inside `runOutsideDbContext` because the request already
 * holds a tenant context: `withSystemDbAccessContext` would otherwise
 * early-return into it (discovery silently returns zero rows), and
 * `withArchivedOrgReadContext` refuses to nest outright.

 *
 * `archived` is the resting state Wave 4 built the door for. The `offboarding`

 * (`offboarding_target = 'archive'`), never a churn drain:
 *
 *  - Both ENDS of the archive transition are visible — `active`/`trial` through
 *    `computeAccessibleOrgIds`, `archived` through this door — and only its
 *    middle was not. So clicking Archive made the org vanish from every list
 *    for the whole drain window (minutes with no agents, up to 72h with a real
 *    fleet), and `POST /organizations/:id/restore` became unreachable from the
 *    UI even though `restoreOrgFromArchive` accepts exactly this state as its
 *    abort edge. That is #4166.
 *  - A CHURN drain ends at `churned`, which is deliberately invisible (same as
 *    `suspended`). Admitting it here would be a NEW visibility policy, would
 *    offer a Restore that `restoreOrgFromArchive` always refuses, and would
 *    render a purge countdown off a `purge_at` that is NULL for churn. If
 *    churn drains should be observable, that wants its own presentation — not
 *    a row flagged `archived: true` under "Archived organizations".
 *
 * ONE definition, shared by discovery, by BOTH serving reads, and by the list
 * route's system-scope exclusion. Two status allowlists drifting apart is
 * exactly what produced #4166; a second copy of this predicate would set up
 * the next one.
