/**
 * Partner activation reconciliation (issue #718).
 *
 * A hosted self-service partner is created `pending` and only becomes
 * `active` once BOTH preconditions are independently satisfied:
 *
 *   1. email verified  → `partners.email_verified_at` is set, and
 *   2. payment attached → `partners.payment_method_attached_at` is set.
 *
 * These two events arrive on independent paths and in either order:
 *
 *   - pay-then-verify: breeze-billing writes `payment_method_attached_at`
 *     (and normally flips status), then the user clicks the verify link.
 *     `consumeVerificationToken` reconciles this ordering.
 *   - verify-then-pay: the user verifies first, then breeze-billing writes
 *     `payment_method_attached_at`. If breeze-billing has a webhook /
 *     idempotency gap and writes the timestamp without flipping status, the
 *     partner is stranded `pending` forever even though both preconditions
 *     are met. `partnerGuard` reconciles this ordering on the next
 *     authenticated request.
 *
 * The predicate below is the SINGLE source of truth shared by both paths so
 * they cannot drift apart.
 *
 * SECURITY / PRODUCT INVARIANTS (issue #718 rescope — do not relax):
 *   - NEVER activate on time elapsed. There is no "it's been N days, let them
 *     in" branch anywhere. A failed signup payment correctly stays `pending`.
 *   - NEVER activate on email-verified alone. `payment_method_attached_at` is
 *     the proof-of-payment gate; activating without it would comp a non-payer.
 *   - ONLY `pending` partners are eligible. `suspended` / `churned` /
 *     soft-deleted partners are never resurrected by reconciliation — that
 *     would undo the abuse-suspension and #568 mid-session cutoff.
 *   - A non-entitled `billing_subscription_status` VETOES activation even when
 *     the payment stamp is present. See below for why this exists.
 *
 * WHY THE VETO EXISTS: the comment that used to sit here claimed
 * `payment_method_attached_at` was "written only by breeze-billing on a
 * confirmed Stripe capture". That was false. breeze-billing's
 * `customer.subscription.updated` handler backfilled the stamp with no regard
 * for `subscription.status`, and Stripe expires an unpaid subscription to
 * `incomplete_expired` ~23h after creation — firing exactly that event. Audited
 * 2026-07-29: 34 of 55 partners carrying the stamp had ZERO successful Stripe
 * charges, and several had been auto-upgraded to a 250-device plan having paid
 * nothing. The writer is fixed, but the stamp is no longer trusted on its own.
 *
 * The veto is deliberately a VETO AND NOT A REQUIREMENT. Requiring a good
 * billing status would defeat #718 in precisely its target failure mode: the
 * `checkout.session.completed` webhook lands and stamps payment, then the
 * `customer.subscription.updated` that would have set the status mirror is lost
 * — a genuine payer stranded `pending` forever. A NULL / unknown mirror
 * therefore still passes. This also keeps the predicate safe across a deploy
 * skew where the API ships before breeze-billing starts populating the mirror.
 *
 * Self-hosted (`IS_HOSTED=false`) partners are created `active` directly by
 * `register-partner`, so they never enter the `pending` state and this
 * predicate simply never matches for them — payment is implicitly waived by
 * never being required in the first place.
