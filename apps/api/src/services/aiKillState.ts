/**
 * Wave 5 Part A (#3827), Task 2 — the DB-backed sibling of the
 * `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_ENABLED` env-flag kill switch: a single-row, epoch'd
 * `ai_kill_state` row (schema: `db/schema/aiKillState.ts`; migration
 * `2026-09-16-ai-agents-policy-decide-foundations.sql`), seeded not-killed.
 *
 * Nothing in THIS PR ever sets `killed = true` — the only write surface is
 * `bumpAiKillState` below, called by nobody yet (Part B or an ops runbook),
 * or a direct SQL `UPDATE` by ops. The guardrail gate this module feeds
 * (`aiGuardrails.ts`'s `checkAgentGuardrails`) is therefore a pure
 * pass-through until one of those two paths flips the row.
 *
 * TWO READ SURFACES, deliberately different shapes:
 *
 *   - `readAiKillState()` (async, I/O, 5s TTL cache) — the real read. Called
 *     from async call sites BEFORE they invoke (or trigger) a guardrail
 *     check, so the module-level cached snapshot below is warm: today that
 *     is `isStoppedBeforeStart` (runLoop.ts, run admission),
 *     `revalidateActExecution` (actRevalidation.ts, immediately before an
 *     act-mode dispatch's live guardrail re-run), and
 *     `checkAgentReleaseAuthority` (agentReleaseAuthority.ts, immediately
 *     before the release-time guardrail re-run). All three share the same
 *     TTL-cached snapshot — none of them is isolated from a poisoned read
 *     left behind by one of the others within the 5s window.
 *   - `getCachedAiKillStateSnapshot()` (sync, no I/O, no TTL check) — the
 *     seam `checkAgentGuardrails` itself reads. `checkAgentGuardrails` is a
 *     pure synchronous function (many callers rely on that, and it is
 *     verified by `aiGuardrails.agentPrincipal.contract.test.ts`), so it
 *     cannot await a fresh DB read on every tool dispatch. It reads whatever
 *     `readAiKillState()` last cached instead.
 *
 * STALENESS BOUND: at most 5s stale IF a caller on the hot path calls
 * `readAiKillState()` at least that often (both current callers do, once per
 * run-admission and once per act-mode dispatch). Before the first call in a
 * process's lifetime — or if no caller ever refreshes it — the cached
 * snapshot stays at its default, `{ killed: false, epoch: 0 }`
 * (pass-through). This default is deliberate, not merely "not yet fail
 * closed": `checkAgentGuardrails` is called directly, with no
 * `readAiKillState()` call anywhere upstream, by a large existing test
 * surface (`aiGuardrails.agentPrincipal.contract.test.ts`,
 * `actionIntents/intentService.test.ts`, `aiAgents/redTeam.contract.test.ts`,
 * `aiAgents/runLoop.test.ts`, …) and by every production caller before this
 * PR shipped — defaulting the sync snapshot to "killed" would deny all of
 * them, which is exactly the observable-behavior change the plan's
 * inertness contract forbids. Fail-closed is enforced the other way: once a
 * read is ATTEMPTED (by any caller, anywhere) and it fails, the cache flips
 * to killed and stays there until a read succeeds.

 * one round trip, and it runs under the system scope this read already opens,
 * which is load-bearing — the actor is whichever platform admin last flipped
 * the switch, and their `users` row may sit under a different partner than the
 * caller's, where `breeze_user_isolation_select` would hide it from an
 * org/partner-scoped read. LEFT (not inner) so an unresolvable actor degrades
