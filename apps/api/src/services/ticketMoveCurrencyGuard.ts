/**
 * Shared locked currency guard for ticket org-moves (multi-currency wave 4,
 * #3776). Used by BOTH movers that rewrite `time_entries` / `ticket_parts`
 * `org_id` through a ticket:
 *   - `moveTicketOrg` (services/ticketService.ts)
 *   - the device org-move (routes/devices/moveOrg.ts — tickets bound to the
 *     moved device travel with it)
 *
 * Snapshots rule: `currency_code` on entries/parts is written once and never
 * restamped. A move into an org that bills in a different currency therefore
 * strands every unbilled monetary row in the OLD currency under the NEW org.
 * That is allowed only when the caller explicitly accepts it
 * (`acceptCurrencyMismatch: true`, gated on `invoices:write` at the route);
 * otherwise the move is blocked with a 409 and nothing moves.
 *
 * Global lock order: tickets → time_entries → ticket_parts → ticket_alert_links
 * → ticket_outbox → ticket_attachments. Call this INSIDE the mover's transaction, AFTER its
 * `UPDATE tickets` (which holds the ticket row lock) and BEFORE the child
 * `org_id` rewrites. `issueInvoice` never locks `tickets` (wave-2 order
 * invoices → invoice_lines → contracts → contract_lines → time_entries →
 * ticket_parts), so no cycle is possible.
 *
 * This function is WHY the order runs that way round: it takes time_entries
 * then ticket_parts `FOR UPDATE` on both axes and cannot be moved later, so
 * the two tables lead and everything else the movers share follows. The full
 * order, and the 40P01 it prevents, is documented in ./ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts
 * (#4657) — that file is the one to change, and both movers must change with it.
