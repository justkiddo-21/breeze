/**
 * Tear down a Quick Support session: tell the client to self-destruct, revoke
 * its credentials, and drop its socket.
 *
 * Ordering is load-bearing:
 *   1. send `support_end` FIRST, while the socket is still authenticated — this
 *      is the cooperative path that makes the client delete itself immediately.
 *   2. revoke all three token hashes and decommission the device, so nothing
 *      can re-authenticate with what it already holds.
 *   3. force-close the socket. Without this a client whose `support_end` was
 *      lost stays happily connected until the 8h hard cap, because it is
 *      online and its own offline dead-man never fires. Closing forces a
 *      reconnect, the reconnect fails re-auth, and the client's dead-man
 *      converges in <=10 minutes.
 *
 * Shared by the tech-initiated end route and the reaper, so both paths revoke
 * identically. Idempotent: a session already in a terminal state returns
 * ended:false rather than re-running the teardown.
