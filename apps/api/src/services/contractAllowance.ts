/**
 * Pure allowance arithmetic (#3205 W04 / #4607). No DB, no I/O, no line-type
 * enum. The ONE definition of how a counted quantity splits into billed +
 * overage, called by resolveLineQty (estimate, contracts list, MRR rollup) AND
 * by generateDueInvoice's own switch, so the four paths can never disagree on
 * QUANTITIES.
 *
 * `baseBillingMode` is an explicit PARAMETER rather than a lineType switch so
 * this module never imports the contract-line enum — which is what lets #4547
 * (block hours) reuse it while it is itself extending that enum.
 *
 * The one money function, `overageValue`, is a single call to the shared
 * exact-decimal primitive `multiplyToCurrency` (scaled-integer multiply, one
 * half-up round at the currency's minor unit). It lives here, not inline in the
 * four callers, because a duplicated money expression is how `Number(a) * b`
 * creeps back in. It imports no enum and touches no DB, so #4547's reuse is
 * unaffected. Accumulation across lines stays with the callers (toCents /
 * fromCents), because only they know what a "period total" is.
