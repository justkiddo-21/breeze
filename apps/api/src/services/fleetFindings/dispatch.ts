/**
 * Remediation dispatch for fleet hygiene findings.
 *
 * `createRemediationRun` is called on the request path (ambient RLS context)
 * and re-validates every requested device NOW, under the caller's current
 * auth — membership can drift between "finding was fetched" and "remediate
 * was clicked" (site grants change, a device gets decommissioned, etc.), so
 * this never trusts a client-supplied device list at face value.
 *
 * `dispatchRunChunk` and `pollRunProgress` are plain functions invoked by the
 * BullMQ worker in `jobs/fleetRemediationDispatch.ts`, which wraps each call
 * in `runOutsideDbContext(() => withSystemDbAccessContext(...))` — mirroring
 * `jobs/fleetFindings.ts`'s `processOrg`. These two functions do not manage
 * DB context themselves so they stay testable as plain functions and so the
 * context-wrapping stays centralized in one place (the worker).
 *
 * commandType mapping:
 *   - 'restart_service' -> CommandTypes.RESTART_SERVICE ('restart_service')
 *   - 'reboot'          -> literal 'reboot'. There is no CommandTypes constant
 *                          for reboot; the literal is the existing precedent
 *                          (devices/schemas.ts, commandQueue.ts's own
 *                          AUTO_AUDIT_COMMAND_TYPES list both spell it out).
 *   - 'clear_temp_files' EXCLUDED: the real disk-cleanup primitive
 *     (aiToolsFilesystem.ts's disk_cleanup tool) requires an existing
 *     filesystem snapshot + a caller-selected set of paths, dispatched as N
 *     `file_delete` commands — it has no single fire-and-forget command
 *     shape compatible with this dispatcher's one-command-per-target model.
 *   - 'script' actionKind (not a commandType) -> CommandTypes.SCRIPT ('script'),
 *     requires `scriptId`; payload built from the resolved script row,
 *     mirroring aiToolsScripts.ts's `run_script` tool. RESTRICTED to scripts
 *     whose parameters are all `runtime`-sourced — see
 *     {@link REMEDIATION_BOUND_PARAMETER_ERROR}.

 * THE single writer of `fleet_remediation_runs`' roll-up columns
 * (`succeeded_count` / `failed_count` / `skipped_count`) and of the derived
 * run `status`/`completed_at`. Every path that terminalizes a target must call
 * this afterwards.
 *
 * Previously the roll-up was recomputed only by `pollRunProgress`, on its 30s
 * scheduler, from an in-memory target snapshot it had read at the top of the
 * function. Two consequences, both shipped:
 *
 *  1. `dispatchRunChunk`'s `markTargetSkipped`/`markTargetFailed` wrote the
 *     target row and nothing else, so between a chunk finishing and the next
 *     poll tick the run's counts read stale — typically all zeros. The web UI
 *     was patched to count target rows itself (#3633), but every other
 *     consumer (the `GET /fleet-findings/runs/:runId` and `GET
 *     /fleet-findings/:id/runs` responses, AI tools, reports) still read the
 *     stale columns. This is issue #3637.
 *  2. The poll's snapshot could not see a concurrently-running chunk's writes,
 *     so it wrote a *lower* count back over a fresher one.
 *
 * The fix is an ABSOLUTE recompute from the target rows — not a per-transition
 * `count = count + 1`. Increments would be wrong here: `markTargetFailed` can
 * legitimately fire twice for one target under a BullMQ chunk retry, so a
 * relative write double-counts, and any drift an increment introduces is
 * permanent. An absolute recompute is idempotent, self-correcting, and repairs
 * rows that historical drift already corrupted. It is also *cheaper* than the
 * increment design the issue considered and rejected: one run-wide write per
 * chunk rather than one per target.
 *
 * `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` before the aggregate is load-bearing, not defensive
 * ceremony. Under READ COMMITTED the `UPDATE`'s subquery reads a snapshot taken
 * at *statement* start, so without the lock two recomputes can interleave and
 * the one that started earlier can overwrite the newer result with older
 * counts — which would, in the worst case, reopen a run the poll worker had
 * already terminalized and unscheduled, stranding it in `running` forever.
 * Taking the row lock first forces the aggregate's snapshot to be taken after
 * any competing recompute has committed.
 *
 * In-flight is counted directly (`pending`/`queued`) rather than derived as
 * `target_count - succeeded - failed - skipped`. Deriving it from the
 * denormalized `target_count` would defeat the point of a self-correcting
 * recompute: a `target_count` that is too high pins the run in `running`
 * forever, one that is too low terminalizes it while targets are still live.
 *
 * `status <> 'cancelled'` because cancellation is an operator decision about
 * the run, not a fact about its targets — a recompute must never resurrect a
 * cancelled run.
