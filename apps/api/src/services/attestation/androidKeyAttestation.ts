/**
 * Android Key Attestation verifier (#1374, feature #4707 wave W04).
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVES, and what it does not:
 *
 * A KeyStore-generated key can carry a certificate chain rooted in a Google
 * hardware attestation root. Exactly one certificate in it carries extension OID
 * `1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.1.17` (`KeyDescription`), which the secure hardware
 * itself populated, and which states the security level the private key lives
 * at plus the single-use challenge the key was created with. That — not Play
 * Integrity — is what lets the server say "this signing key is hardware-bound"
 * and set an `android_{tee,strongbox}_key_attestation` basis.
 *
 * `Software` is REJECTED. A software-backed KeyStore key is an ordinary key in
 * an app-readable store; treating it as platform-bound would re-open exactly
 * the critical-tier bypass this feature exists to close.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous: no database, no network, no clock beyond the injected
 * `now`. Every failure throws — there is no partial success, because a caller
 * that reads a field off a half-verified attestation is a caller that trusts an
 * unverified claim.
 *
 * NOT COVERED (stated so nobody assumes it is):
 *  - Certificate REVOCATION. Google publishes a status list at
 *    `https://android.googleapis.com/attestation/status`; consulting it is a
 *    network call and is deliberately out of this pure module. A revoked
 *    attestation key therefore still verifies here.
 *  - Whether the attested key is the one being registered. The verifier returns
 *    `attestedPublicKeyDer`; binding it to the registration is the CALLER's job
 *    (`verifyPlatformAttestation` does it against the presented SPKI).

 *    the chain can be trusted. Any further instances of the extension have not
 *    been issued by the secure hardware and might have been issued by an

 *
 * The attack: anyone can generate an ordinary KeyStore key with purpose SIGN
 * and digest SHA-256 and receive a GENUINE Google-rooted chain for it. Signing
 * an X.509 TBSCertificate is just signing bytes with SHA-256, so they have the
 * secure hardware sign a certificate they authored for a software key of their
 * own, carrying a KeyDescription that asserts whatever they like, and prepend
 * it. Every signature verifies and the chain still ends at a pinned root.
 *
 * The CA check in `verifyChain` blocks this for a leaf that is CA:FALSE, which
 * a real KeyStore leaf is — but no test in this repo can prove that holds for
 * every KeyMint implementation in the field, so the count is the independent
 * defence and does not rest on that assumption.
 *
 * Rejecting a multi-occurrence chain outright, rather than silently preferring
 * the root-most one, keeps the failure legible: the only way to see two is an
 * extended chain, and that deserves an error naming what happened.
