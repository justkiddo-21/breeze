/**
 * Decide whether an Entra token's address may be linked to a `contacts` row.
 *
 * ── Why this gate exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Linking a login to an existing contact is an AUTHORIZATION decision, not a
 * cosmetic one: `portalTicketOwnership` grants a login sight of every ticket
 * that names its contact, so matching an address is enough to inherit that
 * address's emailed ticket history. An identity claim that anyone can set is
 * therefore not good enough — this is the nOAuth class of account takeover.
 *
 * ── The two conditions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * BOTH must hold:
 *
 *  (a) The address is one Microsoft vouches for. Either it is the
 *      `preferred_username` (the UPN — Entra only issues one on a domain the
 *      tenant owns), or it is the `email` claim AND `xms_edov` is true, which
 *      is the claim Microsoft added so relying parties can tell a verified
 *      address from one an admin typed onto a user object. A bare `email`
 *      claim is refused even when it looks perfectly ordinary.
 *
 *  (b) The address's domain is one the PARTNER has declared this org owns, in
 *      the same `customer_email_domains` table inbound email trusts to route a
 *      sender to a tenant. (a) alone only proves the address belongs to the
 *      Entra tenant; it says nothing about whether that tenant is this Breeze
 *      org's customer, and a mapped tenant can hold addresses on many domains.
 *
 * Exact-domain match only — `bob@mail.acme.com` does NOT match an `acme.com`
 * mapping, matching `resolveOrgBySenderDomain`. A suffix match would accept
 * arbitrary subdomains the MSP never vetted.
 *
 * Read-only, and it makes at most ONE query — both refusals that can be decided
 * from the claims alone are decided before touching the database.
