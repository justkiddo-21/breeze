/**
 * #3525 W05 — stopping a whole automation run.
 *
 * Authorization-free by design, exactly like `scriptCancellation.ts`: the route
 * owns the org / partner-wide / site / MFA gates, this owns the state machine,
 * so the route, a future AI tool and any worker cannot drift apart.
 *
 * ## The fence, and what it actually guarantees
 *
 * Read this before touching either half — the two halves look redundant and
 * are not.
 *
 * `cancelAutomationRun` marks the run `cancelled` while holding `FOR UPDATE`
 * on its row, then sweeps the run's executions AFTER that transaction commits.
 * Every dispatch-side entry point calls `assertRunNotCancelled` first, which
 * reads the same row `FOR SHARE`.
 *
 * **CHECK-BEFORE is not the guarantee.** In production the runtime calls it
 * with the pooled `db`, so the `FOR SHARE` lock is taken and released by that
 * single statement, long before the dispatch it guards (an execution insert,
 * an encrypt, a WebSocket send) even begins. It cannot be held across the
 * dispatch: that would pin a pooled connection across a network round trip for
 * five concurrent devices at a time — the double-hold CLAUDE.md calls out, and
 * a self-deadlock once the pool is exhausted, since `dispatchScriptToDevice`
 * opens connections of its own. So treat check-before as what it is: a cheap
 * early exit that stops the common case (a queued job for a run cancelled
 * minutes ago) from doing any work at all.
 *
 * **CHECK-AFTER is the guarantee.** `automationRuntime`'s
 * `cancelDispatchIfRunCancelled` re-reads the run once the dispatch has
 * committed and stops the execution itself if the run went `cancelled`
 * meanwhile. Postgres gives the needed ordering for free without any lock:
 * whichever of {the cancel's post-commit sweep, this dispatcher's re-read}
 * runs second sees the other's committed write. So every script execution of a
 * cancelled run is either found by the sweep or stopped by its own dispatcher.
 *
 * **DO NOT delete `cancelDispatchIfRunCancelled` on the belief that the row
 * lock already covers it.** It does not, and removing it reopens the race.
 *
 * Scope of the guarantee: SCRIPT EXECUTIONS only. `execute_command` and
 * `deploy_software` actions have no agent-side stop at all — they genuinely do
 * run to completion after a cancel, and are reported to the operator through
 * `uncancellableActions` rather than claimed stopped (see
 * `UNCANCELLABLE_ACTION_REASONS` below).
