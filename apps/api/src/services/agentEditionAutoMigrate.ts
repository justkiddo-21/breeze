/**
 * Automatic agent edition migration (#4072 follow-up).
 *
 * The heartbeat's artifact-edition gate (agentEditionCompat.ts) withholds
 * update offers from self-host-edition builds that would refuse a
 * hosted-edition artifact — leaving those devices permanently stranded on
 * their installed version, because the refusal is agent-side and cannot be
 * fixed OTA. The only recovery is the identity-preserving MSI reinstall the
 * 'Migrate Agent Edition (Windows)' system script performs
 * (systemScriptLibrary.ts, PR #4102), which until now an operator had to
 * dispatch by hand per device.
 *
 * This module closes the loop: when the gate withholds an offer for a live
 * Windows/amd64 device, the heartbeat calls maybeDispatchEditionMigration()
 * fire-and-forget, and — behind a default-off env flag — the script is
 * dispatched automatically with a server-derived MSI URL + sha256.
 *
 * Safety rails, in order of evaluation:
 *  - AGENT_EDITION_AUTO_MIGRATE_ENABLED must be exactly 'true' (default off).
 *  - Hosted-serving deployments only: hosted builds hard-refuse self-host
 *    artifacts BY DESIGN, so the hosted→self-host direction is never
 *    auto-migrated.
 *  - Windows/amd64 only — the migration script and the staged MSI are.
 *  - The org's effective update policy + maintenance window gate
 *    (updateGateAllows, resolved by the heartbeat) must allow an update right
 *    now: the migration IS this device's update, delivered differently.
 *  - The tenant's version pin is honoured via resolveTarget (the same
 *    resolvePinnedUpgradeTarget the offer path uses): no resolvable target, or
 *    a target not newer than the installed version (a holdback pin), means no
 *    migration. Pinning an org to its current version therefore acts as the
 *    operator hold for auto-migration too.
 *  - ONE attempt per device, ever: an atomic claim on
 *    devices.edition_migration_dispatched_at (UPDATE ... WHERE ... IS NULL)
 *    makes concurrent heartbeats race safely, and a dispatched-but-failed MSI
 *    dance is never auto-retried into an uninstall/reinstall loop — that
 *    device is an operator's to look at (Sentry has it). Only a dispatch that
 *    never reached the queue releases the claim, and even then an in-process
 *    dedupe stops hot retry loops until the API restarts.
 *
 * The MSI is served by the RAW installer route this feature ships with
 * (GET /api/v1/agents/download/windows/amd64/msi, routes/agents/download.ts):
 * unlike the enrollment installer routes, it embeds no per-download bootstrap
 * token, so its bytes match the staged file and the sha256 pin computed here.
 * Both route and hash read the same AGENT_BINARY_DIR file, so the pin can only
 * mismatch if the file changes between dispatch and download — in which case
 * the script verifies-then-aborts before touching the installed agent.
 *
 * MUST be invoked outside the heartbeat's request transaction (the hook wraps
 * the call in runOutsideDbContext + withSystemDbAccessContext): the caller
 * fires it detached, and the org-scoped withDbAccessContext transaction it
 * would otherwise inherit commits when the handler returns — leaving this
 * promise's queries pointed at a dead tx handle. System context is safe here:
 * every value dispatched was validated inside the org-scoped block, and
 * dispatchScriptToDevice's own org-equality invariant still applies.
