/**
 * Platform-admin AI kill-switch API (wave 6 PR 2, #3828 — Task 4).
 *
 *   GET  /api/v1/admin/ai-kill-state          state + epoch + provenance
 *   POST /api/v1/admin/ai-kill-state          flip it (+ MFA, reason required)
 *
 * The GET's provenance carries the actor as a resolved name/email alongside
 * the raw `updatedBy` UUID (`readAiKillStateRow`, #4931) — both null when the
 * user row is gone, which the UI degrades to the UUID rather than a blank.
 *
 * This is the first AUTHORIZED write surface for `ai_kill_state` — the row
 * shipped in wave 5A with `bumpAiKillState` deliberately uncalled, leaving a
 * direct SQL UPDATE as the only operational path. WHY PLATFORM-ADMIN ONLY:
 * the row is global (id='global', no tenant axis) — flipping it stops
 * unattended AI activity for EVERY partner at once, which is a platform
 * operation by construction, same posture as tenant-erasure.
 *
 * Propagation bound: each API process re-reads the row on its hot paths with
 * a 5s TTL cache (`services/aiKillState.ts`), so a flip takes effect
 * everywhere within ~5 seconds — the GET here bypasses that cache and shows
 * the database truth. Operational runbook (including the SQL fallback for
 * when no platform admin exists — true of production today):
 * `docs/deploy/ai-kill-switch.md`.
