/**
 * #3258 W03 — portal ticket ownership, on COMPILED SQL.
 *
 * A portal user's own tickets used to be exactly `submitted_by = <their id>`.
 * Once inbound email attributes to a contact instead of a password-less login,
 * a customer who emails support and then logs into the portal would see none
 * of their own tickets: the emailed ones carry `requester_contact_id` and no
 * `submitted_by` at all.
 *
 * The OR arm is conditional, and that condition is the whole test. Drizzle
 * compiles `eq(col, null)` to a literal `= NULL`, which is never true in SQL —
 * a portal user with no linked contact would silently match nothing on that
 * arm, and (worse) the same construction on a broader predicate is how rows go
 * missing without an error. A builder-shape assertion cannot see any of this;
 * only the compiled string and its params can.
