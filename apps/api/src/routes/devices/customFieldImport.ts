/**
 * The VALUES half of the RMM custom-field importer (#3257 W08):
 * `POST /devices/custom-fields/import/preview` and
 * `POST /devices/custom-fields/import`.
 *
 * Lives under `/devices` rather than beside the definitions pair
 * (`routes/customFieldImport.ts`) because it is a different pipeline with
 * different tenancy: definitions are dual-axis config owned by an organization
 * XOR a partner, values are device-scoped rows in one organization.
 *
 * ── Auth wiring — PER-ROUTE, never `.use('*')` ──────────────────────────────
 * A wildcard `.use('*')` in a sub-router attaches to every route mounted AFTER
 * it in `devices/index.ts`. This router is mounted immediately after
 * `customFieldValuesRoutes`, whose X-API-Key branch a wildcard here would
 * shadow and whose 401 it would resurrect (issue #2066) — so the middleware is
 * attached per route and `customFieldImport.mountorder.test.ts` proves, through
 * the fully-assembled router, that the API-key PATCH still reaches its handler.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT here ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is **no `dualAuth` / X-API-Key branch**, matching W07. `dualAuth`
 * applies `requireMfa` only on the JWT branch and skips the site allowlist for
 * API keys; an unattended integration is not a user of a one-off migration
 * tool. With plain `authMiddleware` an X-API-Key-only request never
 * authenticates at all — a 401, which is the intended answer.
 *
 * ── Always 200 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both routes answer 200 even with a non-empty `errors[]`. The web caller
 * consumes them through `runAction`, which reads a failure body as a hard
 * failure and would hide the rows that DID import. Per-row problems ride as
 * typed `errors[].code`, never free text.
