/**
 * Guard against the "new service image ships without the OpenSSL upgrade the
 * other images have" class (issue #4246).
 *
 * Every production image in this repo pins its base by digest. A pinned digest
 * freezes the Alpine package set at whatever shipped that day, so when upstream
 * publishes a fix for a libcrypto3/libssl3 CVE the image keeps the vulnerable
 * version until someone bumps the digest. The established mitigation is to
 * refresh just those two packages in the runtime stage:
 *
 *   RUN apk upgrade --no-cache libcrypto3 libssl3 && \
 *       rm -rf ...
 *
 * `docker/Dockerfile.api`, `docker/Dockerfile.web` and `apps/portal/Dockerfile`
 * carried that line; the three M365 executor images were added later and never
 * got it, so `Trivy Image Scan` went red on `main` for CVE-2026-14456 and stayed
 * red across six unrelated PRs — a permanently-red security job stops being a
 * signal and starts masking real findings.
 *
 * This is a static text check over the Dockerfiles; it never invokes Docker.
 *
 * Two things make the naive check ("does the file contain `apk upgrade`?")
 * wrong, and this guard models both:
 *
 *  1. **Stage placement.** A build stage is discarded — an upgrade there fixes
 *     nothing while looking perfectly correct in a diff. Only the final stage
 *     is shipped.
 *  2. **Stage inheritance.** `FROM base AS runner` *inherits* base's filesystem,
 *     so an upgrade run in `base` genuinely does reach the shipped image (this
 *     is how `docker/Dockerfile.api` is structured). But `COPY --from=builder`
 *     copies only named paths and carries no package state, so an upgrade in a
 *     stage that is merely copied from does NOT count.
 *
 * So the rule is: the upgrade must appear somewhere in the final stage's
 * `FROM`-inheritance chain.
 *
 * Which Dockerfiles are in scope is derived from the files themselves rather
 * than hand-listed: an image is in scope when its final stage's inheritance
 * chain bottoms out at a digest-pinned `node:*-alpine` base. That is exactly the
 * set that both ships to users and freezes its package set. The `.dev` images
 * use a floating tag (they re-pull fixes on every rebuild and are never shipped)
 * and `docker/Dockerfile.binaries` is a non-node `alpine:*` packaging image, so
 * both fall out of scope on the base ref, with no allowlist to rot.
 *
 * Because that classification is derived, a companion test snapshots it — if a
 * new image appears, or a base ref changes shape, the snapshot fails and forces
 * a human to decide which side of the line it belongs on, rather than letting an
 * image drop silently out of coverage.
 *
 * Two assumptions this guard rests on, recorded so they are not rediscovered
 * the hard way:
 *
 *  - **"Last stage in the file" == "the stage that ships."** True for every
 *    Dockerfile here today, but a `docker build --target <stage>` in a workflow
 *    would ship an earlier stage and quietly defeat the whole check. Nothing in
 *    the repo does that at present.
 *  - The supply-chain contract below proves the hardening *rule text* still
 *    admits only the exact two-package CVE repair; it cannot prove the
 *    hardening *script* is still wired into CI. If that script were dropped
 *    from its workflow the control would stop running while this suite stayed
 *    green.
