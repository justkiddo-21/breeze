/**
 * RMM-QA-176 D5 — the persisted manual maintenance lease on `devices`.
 *
 * `POST /devices/:id/maintenance` echoed `durationHours` into an audit detail
 * and threw it away, so there was no durable record of who suppressed
 * monitoring on a device, why, or until when — and "extend the window" was not
 * a distinguishable operation. `2026-10-12-000100-device-manual-maintenance-
 * lease.sql` adds that record: maintenance_started_at / maintenance_until /
 * maintenance_reason / maintenance_started_by, plus
 * `devices_maintenance_lease_chk`, which forbids a HALF-written lease.
 *
 * This suite pins the four things later tasks (6, 7, 8, 9, 12) build on, all
 * against the real migrated database rather than the Drizzle declaration:
 *
 *  - the column set, its types and its nullability (a `timestamptz` that
 *    shipped as `timestamp` would silently shift every window by the server's
 *    offset, and Drizzle's `withTimezone: true` is a claim about the DB, not a
 *    guarantee from it);
 *  - the CHECK actually REJECTS each half-written shape — an `until` with no
 *    start/reason, a reason with no window, a start with no end — because a
 *    constraint that is merely present proves nothing;
 *  - `ON DELETE SET NULL` on the actor: erasing a user must never be blocked by
 *    a device that happens to be in maintenance, and must not silently clear
 *    the window either (which is why the CHECK deliberately permits a null
 *    actor beside a live lease);
 *  - re-applying the migration is a no-op, and every new column is registered
 *    in the devices tenant-export policy (F12 — `devices` is an org-cascade
 *    table whose policy enumerates every column, so an unregistered one fails
 *    tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts with `unclassified`; the local
 *    assertion here says WHY when that happens).
 *
 * Prerequisites (private per-worktree stack — never `test:docker:up`):
 *   pnpm test-stack up
 *
 * Run:
 *   pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts \
 *     src/__tests__/integration/deviceMaintenanceLease.integration.test.ts
