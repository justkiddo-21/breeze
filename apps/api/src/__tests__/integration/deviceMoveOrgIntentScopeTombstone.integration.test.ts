/**
 * Live-Postgres coverage for #4454: `breeze_cascade_device_org_id()` must
 * tombstone `action_intents.scope_device_id` for every LIVE intent aimed at a
 * device that is leaving its org — not only when the move goes through the
 * `POST /devices/:id/move-org` route.
 *
 * WHY THIS NEEDS A REAL DATABASE
 * ------------------------------
 * The behaviour under test lives entirely inside a Postgres trigger function.
 * No TypeScript executes: `UPDATE devices SET org_id = ...` is the whole input,
 * and the tombstone is a side effect of the AFTER-UPDATE trigger. A mocked
 * suite can only assert the *shape* of the SQL text in the migration — which is
 * what `routes/devices/moveOrg.coverage.test.ts` does, statically, in the unit
 * job. It cannot catch any of the three ways this statement could be present
 * and still not work:
 *
 *   1. FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY on `action_intents` silently matching zero rows
 *      (the exact failure mode 2026-09-29's header warns about for a bare
 *      migration-time cleanup, and the one recorded for managed Postgres
 *      backfills that omit `breeze.scope`). A tombstone that reports success
 *      while updating nothing is indistinguishable from the bug it fixes.
 *   2. `action_intents_block_content_update()` — the BEFORE UPDATE immutability
 *      trigger — rejecting the write. It permits `scope_device_id` non-null ->
 *      NULL and nothing else, so a future tightening of that deny-list would
 *      raise `action_intents content is immutable` and abort the whole device
 *      move.
 *
 * `action_intents_scope_device_chk` is deliberately NOT on that list, though it
 * sits right beside the trigger: `scope_device_id IS NULL OR scope_kind =
 * 'device'` is satisfied by ANY row whose id is NULL, so the tombstone cannot
 * violate it and no test here proves anything about it. Naming it as a third
 * guarded hazard would be a claim this suite does not earn.
 *
 * The two suites are complementary and deliberately both exist: the static one
 * fails fast in the blocking `test-api` job when the statement is deleted or
 * drifts from the route, this one proves the statement actually does something
 * against a real server.
 *
 * TWO CALLERS, ONE TRIGGER. The move is driven twice, because the two
 * non-route paths reach the trigger through different privilege levels and
 * only the second can expose failure mode 1:
 *
 *   - as the SUPERUSER admin client (`getTestDb()`) — the literal "somebody ran
 *     UPDATE in psql" path, RLS-exempt;
 *   - as the unprivileged `breeze_app` role under `withSystemDbAccessContext`
 *     — the shape every real non-route caller has, orgMerge's `devices` repoint
 *     included. `breeze_has_org_access()` grants system scope, so the trigger's
 *     UPDATE must match here too; if it silently matched zero rows this case is
 *     the one that goes red.
 *
 * THE TERMINAL-STATUS CONTROL IS NOT OPTIONAL. Every case also seeds a
 * `completed` intent pointing at the same device and asserts it is left ALONE.
 * A tombstone that fired unconditionally would rewrite the historical target of
 * an action that was already decided and executed — which the schema comment on
 * `actionIntents.scopeDeviceId` explicitly forbids, and which an assertion that
 * only checked the live row would happily pass.
 *
 * FIXTURES ARE PER-TEST. The shared integration setup (`./setup`) TRUNCATEs the
 * core tenant tables in a global `beforeEach`, so seeding in `beforeAll` would
 * be CASCADE-deleted before the second case runs.
