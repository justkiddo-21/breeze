/**
 * Contract test: no foreign key silently blocks GDPR org erasure (#4519).
 *
 * WHAT BREAKS WITHOUT THIS
 *
 * `cascadeDeleteOrg()` erases a tenant with a sequence of ordinary DELETE
 * statements, each in its own system context -- it is NOT one big deferred
 * transaction, so Postgres checks every referencing FK as each statement runs:
 *
 *   step 1b  each `ASSOCIATED_SYSTEM_SCOPED_TABLES` entry, in array order,
 *            with its own hand-written WHERE join;
 *   step 2   every table in `getOrgCascadeDeleteOrder()`, ordered
 *            children-before-parents by `topologicalCascadeOrder()`'s live
 *            `pg_constraint` read, as `DELETE ... WHERE org_id = $1`
 *            (`organizations` itself is keyed on `id`).
 *
 * A foreign key pointing at any table those statements touch is a latent
 * erasure failure unless something clears the referencing rows first. Erasure
 * then works right up until a customer creates the first row in the
 * referencing table, and after that aborts mid-way and leaves the tenant
 * half-deleted. That is exactly how #4100 shipped
 * (`webhook_deliveries.webhook_id -> webhooks.id`, fixed in #4412), and the
 * sweep on that PR found ~73 more edges with the same shape. Nothing guarded
 * it: `tenantCascade.integration.test.ts` checks list membership and
 * topological ordering *within* the cascade set, but never looks at inbound
 * edges from outside it or at `confdeltype` at all; neither does the RLS
 * coverage contract or the export-policy roundtrip.
 *
 * THE SAFETY MODEL
 *
 * `protectedTables` is every table erasure deletes rows from: the cascade set,
 * the step-1b pre-clear targets, and -- transitively -- everything reachable
 * from those by an `ON DELETE CASCADE` edge, since a cascading delete makes
 * that table's own inbound FKs get checked too.
 *
 * For an edge `child -> parent` with `parent` in that set, `classifyEdge()`
 * calls it safe when:
 *
 *   a) the action is `CASCADE` -- Postgres removes the child rows, and the
 *      child is itself in `protectedTables` by the closure above, so its own
 *      inbound edges are audited on their own;
 *   b) the action is `SET NULL` AND every column Postgres would actually null
 *      (`confdelsetcols`, else the whole `conkey`) is nullable. A `SET NULL`
 *      onto a NOT NULL column is accepted at DDL time and fails at delete time
 *      with 23502 -- the former `action_intents -> tickets` bug (#4872);
 *   c) the child is a step-1b pre-clear target and that pre-clear runs before
 *      the parent's DELETE -- always true when the parent is only in the
 *      cascade set, and otherwise decided by array order;
 *   d) both ends are in the cascade set, so `topologicalCascadeOrder()` puts
 *      the child first;
 *   e) the edge is self-referential AND the table's `org_id` is NOT NULL.
 *
 * (e) is the subtle one. A self-reference is normally safe because one
 * statement removes the org's whole row set and NO ACTION is checked at
 * end-of-statement -- and, verified empirically against Postgres 16, RESTRICT
 * behaves the same way here: it is an AFTER-ROW trigger, not a per-row
 * immediate check, so it too tolerates a row set closed under the FK. What
 * actually matters is that closure. A nullable `org_id` breaks it: under the
 * partner-wide config shape (epic #2135) `WHERE org_id = $1` leaves the
 * partner-owned rows behind, and a surviving row pointing at a deleted one
 * raises 23503 regardless of the action. `script_categories.parent_id` was in
 * exactly that state until #4873, which fixed it forward with `ON DELETE SET
 * NULL` -- so it is now safe under (b), not (e).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE
 *
 * It is a catalog contract, not a data one:
 *
 *   - a CROSS-TENANT row (org B's child pointing at org A's parent) still
 *     breaks erasure under (c) and (d), because those DELETEs only remove org
 *     A's rows. Detecting it needs data; RLS is what is supposed to make it
 *     impossible. Two pre-clear entries carry notes where the pre-clear's join
 *     column differs from the FK's, which is where that assumption is loadest;
 *   - under (c) it cannot read the hand-written `clearSql` to confirm the join
 *     reaches the rows a given FK pins. Pinning per FK rather than per table is
 *     what forces a human to go look when a new FK lands on such a table.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE
 *
 * Under `src/__tests__/integration/`, so the shared glob in
 * `vitest.integration.config.ts` carries it into the blocking Integration
 * Tests shard with no CI wiring of its own to fall out of date. That does mean
 * it inherits setup.ts's per-test TRUNCATE CASCADE, which a read-only catalog
 * read has no use for; the alternative (the dedicated-runner pattern
 * `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` uses, which needs its own config plus a
 * hand-maintained CI step) was weighed and rejected -- measured overhead here
 * is well under a second per test against a 25-minute shard budget.
 *
 * Scope is the ORG cascade. The device cascade
 * (`CORE_DEVICE_CASCADE_DELETE_TABLES`) and the partner purge are separate
 * contracts. The seeded ledger lives in `orgCascadeFkOnDeleteAllowlist.ts`;
 * read its header before adding a line.
