/**
 * Cross-axis `field_key` shadowing — #3257 W03.
 *
 * Migration under test:
 * `2026-10-11-141000-custom-field-no-cross-axis-shadowing.sql`.
 *
 * THE RULE. One EFFECTIVE `field_key` namespace per device. `devices.custom_fields`
 * is a flat jsonb object keyed by a bare string, so if an org-owned `udf7` and a
 * partner-wide `udf7` can both exist for one org, that one datum has two
 * definitions: the partner export emits two records for it (the identity hash
 * includes `f.id` — routes/partnerApi/configuration.ts:436,439), W05's
 * `device_custom_field_values` cannot project back into the jsonb without loss,
 * and W05's backfill cannot attribute an existing blob value to either one.
 *
 * WHY A TRIGGER. Uniqueness here spans two NULLABLE ownership columns over
 * DISJOINT row sets, and the partner half of the pair is not even on the
 * org-owned row — it is reached through `organizations.partner_id`. No index can
 * express that, which is why W02 shipped two PARTIAL unique indexes and left
 * this case open (pinned there as a passing boundary case,
 * `customFieldDefinitionIntegrity.integration.test.ts`).
 *
 * WHY BOTH SCOPES ARE EXERCISED. The tenant-scope tests prove the guard holds
 * for the callers that actually create this collision — POST /custom-fields pins
 * `orgId = auth.orgId` for every org-scoped caller, so an org token creating an
 * org-owned key is by far the most common way to shadow a partner-wide one. They
 * also pin that RLS remains the stricter outer wall (42501 on a forged
 * partner-wide row) and that the trigger's scope elevation does not leak into the
 * caller's transaction.
 *
 * #4944 NOTE. `custom_field_definitions_partner_wide_select`
 * (2026-10-13-110000-custom-field-definitions-partner-wide-select.sql) added a
 * SELECT-only branch letting an org token read its OWN partner's partner-wide
 * rows. That changed one control in this file (see the inverted comment in
 * `refuses a shadowing insert under the caller's own org scope`) and nothing
 * else: the branch grants no write, so the 42501 forge assertions are untouched,
 * and the trigger runs BEFORE ROW regardless of what the caller can see.
 *
 * WHAT THE TENANT-SCOPE TESTS DO **NOT** PROVE, and the trap that is worth your
 * time before you "simplify" the migration. The function is SECURITY DEFINER, so
 * its lookups run as its OWNER — the role that applied the migration. On this
 * stack and in CI that role is a SUPERUSER with BYPASSRLS (`breeze_test`:
 * rolsuper=t, rolbypassrls=t), which ignores RLS outright. So every behavioural
 * test in this file passes IDENTICALLY with or without the in-body
 * `set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true)` elevation — measured, not
 * assumed: with the elevation stripped, the four tenant-scope tests below still
 * went 4/4 green.
 *
 * Whether the elevation matters therefore depends on the owner, which differs
 * per deployment: hosted prod's `doadmin` is not a superuser but does carry
 * BYPASSRLS (see apps/api/scripts/check-migrations-nonsuperuser.ts), so it is
 * probably covered by ownership alone today; a self-hosted owner without
 * BYPASSRLS is bound by `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and is not. A/B on this same
 * database with an otherwise identical pair of SECURITY DEFINER lookups
 * reassigned to the non-superuser, non-BYPASSRLS `breeze_app`, called under an
 * org-scoped context, gave: unelevated → row NOT found; elevated → row found.
 * That is the bug the elevation prevents, and it is invisible to every
 * behavioural test here. Same CI-superuser blind spot `migrationRlsScope.test.ts`
 * exists for.
 *
 * Hence `pins the in-body scope elevation on the trigger function` below asserts
 * the function's stored BODY from the CATALOG (`pg_get_functiondef`) rather than
 * through behaviour. It is not belt-and-braces; on this stack it is the ONLY
 * assertion in the file that can fail when the elevation is removed. Do not
 * delete it as redundant.
 *
 * WHY THE BODY AND NOT `pg_proc.proconfig`. The elegant form of this is the
 * function attribute `SET "breeze.scope" = 'system'`, which Postgres saves and
 * restores automatically and which lands in `proconfig`. It cannot ship: setting
 * a CUSTOM (dotted) GUC as a function attribute is superuser-only, so prod's
 * non-superuser migration role gets `42501 permission denied to set parameter`
 * at CREATE FUNCTION time and the deploy crash-loops (the v0.97.0 EU incident;
 * `src/db/migrationGucAttributes.test.ts` and the `Check Migrations
 * (non-superuser)` job both guard it). `proconfig` is therefore NULL by design
 * for this function apart from search_path, and the sanctioned pattern is
 * in-body save/elevate/restore — reference implementation
 * `breeze_revalidate_config_policy_feature_references`
 * (2026-07-27-a-feature-policy-reference-ownership.sql).
 *
 * ORDERING NOTE. W02's XOR is a CHECK constraint, so under a tenant context RLS
 * `WITH CHECK` rejects the row with 42501 *before* the constraint is evaluated
 * (asserted in `customFieldDefinitionsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts`). This
 * guard is a BEFORE ROW trigger, which `ExecInsert` runs *ahead* of both
 * `ExecWithCheckOptions` and `ExecConstraints` — so it surfaces as P0001 even
 * under a tenant context. The two behaviours are asserted separately below
 * (`refuses ... under the caller's own org scope` vs. `an org token still cannot
 * forge a partner-wide row`) so neither can be mistaken for the other.
