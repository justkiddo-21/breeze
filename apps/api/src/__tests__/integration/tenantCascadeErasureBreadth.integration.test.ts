/**
 * Breadth + failure-semantics coverage for `cascadeDeleteOrg` (#3880).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists alongside `tenantCascadeExecution.integration.test.ts`
 *
 * `tenantCascadeExecution.integration.test.ts` already drives the real
 * erasure end-to-end, but it is a *regression* suite: its fixture is shaped
 * around the specific bugs it was written for (#4100 webhook_deliveries, the
 * QuickBooks polymorphic mapping pre-clear, the #3258 composite portal_users
 * FK). It seeds a handful of tables and asserts those tables by name.
 *
 * That leaves the property #3880 actually asks for unproven: that an erasure
 * of a *broad* org removes **every** row keyed on it across the whole cascade
 * list, and that the erasure's documented failure behaviour is what the code
 * really does. This file covers the shape classes the regression fixture does
 * not reach, and — critically — asserts residual rows generically over all
 * ~300 entries of `getOrgCascadeDeleteOrder()` rather than over a hand-listed
 * few, so a table added to the list later is swept without editing this test.
 *
 * Shape classes seeded here, one per `it`:
 *
 * - **Append-only / audit-admin escalation beyond `audit_logs`.**
 *   `ml_feedback_events` is in `AUDIT_ADMIN_REQUIRED_TABLES`; `breeze_app` has
 *   no DELETE grant on it AND a BEFORE DELETE trigger blocks the row. Only the
 *   `SET LOCAL ROLE breeze_audit_admin` + `SET LOCAL breeze.allow_audit_retention`
 *   pair inside `cascadeDeleteOrg` can remove it. The test includes a negative
 *   control proving the app role genuinely cannot, so the escalation branch is
 *   load-bearing rather than incidental.
 * - **Self-referencing chain.** `quotes.revision_of_quote_id` is a composite
 *   `(revision_of_quote_id, org_id) -> quotes(id, org_id)` FK with NO ACTION.
 *   A 3-deep revision lineage must come out in the single
 *   `DELETE FROM quotes WHERE org_id = $1` statement. This is the exact shape
 *   that produced #3880 in the first place (found while writing the #3879 W06
 *   revision-lineage tests).
 * - **Device-scoped table with a denormalized `org_id`.** `device_hardware`
 *   and `alerts` carry both `device_id` and `org_id`; their `device_id` FK has
 *   NO ACTION, so they must be deleted before `devices` or the walk raises
 *   23503. The regression suite seeds no devices at all.
 * - **Partner-wide config row (`org_id` NULL XOR `partner_id`).** A
 *   partner-wide `maintenance_windows` row belongs to no org and MUST survive
 *   the erasure of one of that partner's orgs — deleting it would silently
 *   destroy config for every sibling org.
 *
 * ## Failure semantics (the second half of #3880)
 *
 * The last `describe` pins what a mid-walk failure actually does, because the
 * source comment ("partial deletion is worse than no deletion") reads as if
 * the cascade were atomic and it is not. Each table's DELETE runs in its own
 * `withSystemDbAccessContext`, which opens its own `baseDb.transaction(...)`
 * (`apps/api/src/db/index.ts`) — so every table that succeeded is ALREADY
 * COMMITTED when a later one fails. The real contract is:
 *
 *   fail fast → leave the partial erasure in place → record
 *   `tenant.erasure.failed` (org_id NULL, so it survives) with per-table
 *   progress → stay re-runnable, because the walk is idempotent.
 *
 * The test induces the failure the same way production hit it in #4100: an FK
 * child with no ON DELETE action pointing into a cascade-list table.
 *
 * ## Partner-wide self-reference (`script_categories`, #4873)
 *
 * The third `describe` covers the shape PR #4863 (issue #4519) proved was a
 * live erasure failure: a partner-wide category (`org_id` NULL) whose
 * `parent_id` points at an org-owned one SURVIVES `DELETE ... WHERE org_id =
 * $1` and used to raise 23503. It is fixed in two layers, and both are pinned
 * here — the constraint trigger that makes the row unconstructible, and the
 * `ON DELETE SET NULL` that makes erasure survive it anyway (proven by forging
 * the row with the trigger disabled, so the FK action is the only thing left
 * doing the work).
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT seeded
 *
 * `restore_jobs.command_id` (#4871) remains an open bug. Seeding it here would
 * make this suite red for a defect it is not fixing, so it is skipped on
 * purpose and named instead.
