/**
 * Regression: the AI agent could not run ANY approval-gated tool on US prod
 * (every execute_command returned "Tool execution was rejected or timed out",
 * including read-only list_processes). Users had to manually flag the chat.
 *
 * Root cause: waitForApproval() (services/aiAgent.ts) polls ai_tool_executions
 * through the bare `db` pool. The AI Agent SDK runs its session OUTSIDE the
 * request's AsyncLocalStorage DB context (by design — the SDK query() is
 * wrapped in runOutsideDbContext in streamingSessionManager.ts, to avoid
 * holding a request txn open for the whole stream), so inside waitForApproval
 * the `db` proxy resolves to the unprivileged `breeze_app` role with NO
 * `breeze.*` GUCs. ai_tool_executions has forced RLS, so the SELECT matched
 * 0 rows and `if (!execution) return false` fired on the first poll — even
 * after the user clicked Approve (which flips the row to 'approved' via the
 * authenticated, context-bound /approvals route).
 *
 * Same silent-0-row class as #1375; the contextless-write guard doesn't cover
 * SELECT, so nothing surfaced in logs.
 *
 * These tests run against a real DB as `breeze_app` (forced RLS) and call
 * waitForApproval with NO ambient context, exactly as the SDK does. They fail
 * (RED) until waitForApproval establishes a system-scope context for its poll.
