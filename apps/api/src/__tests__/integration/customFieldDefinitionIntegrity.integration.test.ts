/**
 * custom_field_definitions integrity constraints — #3257 W02.
 *
 * Migration under test:
 * `2026-10-10-100300-custom-field-definition-integrity.sql`.
 *
 * The table shipped in the squashed baseline with a primary key and two
 * foreign keys and NOTHING else (0001-baseline.sql:6761-6766, 11891-11907; no
 * later migration adds an index). That leaves two defects that #3257's
 * definitions importer would industrialise:
 *
 *  1. **No unique key on `field_key`.** A definitions import therefore has no
 *     idempotency key, so re-running it mints a duplicate `udf7`. Two
 *     definitions sharing one key also make the partner export emit two
 *     records for one datum, because the identity hash includes `f.id`
 *     (routes/partnerApi/configuration.ts).
 *  2. **`(org_id, partner_id) = (NULL, NULL)` is structurally legal.** Such a
 *     row is invisible to every non-system caller AND survives org cascade
 *     forever, because the cascade deletes by `org_id`. A latent GDPR orphan.
 *
 * Every assertion here runs under SYSTEM scope on purpose. Under an org- or
 * partner-scoped context the dual-axis RLS WITH CHECK
 * (2026-06-11-i-custom-fields-dual-axis-rls.sql) rejects an ownerless row with
 * 42501 *before* the CHECK constraint is ever evaluated — see
 * `customFieldDefinitionsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts`, which asserts that
 * ordering explicitly. System scope short-circuits `breeze_has_org_access` to
 * TRUE, which is the only way to reach the constraint itself and prove the
 * table is safe even for a caller RLS does not stop (migrations, backfills,
 * and the importer's own system-context writes all run there).
