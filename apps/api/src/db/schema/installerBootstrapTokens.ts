/**
 * Short-TTL token issued at installer-download time, redeemable up to
 * max_usage times (once per device that installs the same downloaded
 * installer — see consumed_count). The token is delivered inside the platform
 * installer (macOS zip payload, or embedded in the Windows MSI download
 * filename) and exchanged for enrollment values on first launch via POST
 * `/api/v1/installer/bootstrap`. Legacy raw enrollment-key query tokens are
 * not accepted by public installer downloads; callers must use the
 * short-lived handle flow.
 *
 * Stored as plain text (not hashed) intentionally: tokens are ephemeral
 * (24h max) and hashing adds ceremony without a meaningful security win for
 * this lifetime. Compare by equality. Note a leaked token is worth up to
 * max_usage enrollments, so keep the TTL short and the max_usage bounded.

     *   - `per_download`  — minted by a PUBLIC download (`serveInstaller`), one
     *                       hardcoded `max_usage: 1` token per click. Summing
     *                       these counts downloads, not device slots, so they

     * short_code-LESS download key. `parent.short_code` — the previous proxy —
     * was wrong in both directions.
