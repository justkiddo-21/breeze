/**
 * Run a read of a PARTNER-AXIS table in a system RLS context (issue #2822).
 *
 * Partner-axis tables (`partners`, and everything in `PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES` in
 * `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts`) are
 * gated by `breeze_has_partner_access(...)`, which evaluates against the
 * `breeze.accessible_partner_ids` GUC. `computeAccessiblePartnerIds`
 * (apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts) returns `[]` for `scope === 'organization'`,
 * and agentAuth / clientAiAuth / portal auth / org-scoped OAuth bearers all set
 * `accessiblePartnerIds: []` too. Under those contexts the read returns ZERO
 * ROWS — it does not raise — so the value silently collapses to a default, an
 * empty list, or a spurious 404, for exactly the population the feature was
 * meant to serve. A mocked-DB unit test cannot see this; only real Postgres can.
 *
 * Callers must keep the lookup hard-pinned to an id that came from the verified
 * auth context (e.g. `auth.partnerId`) or from a row already resolved under the
 * caller's own RLS context. Escaping RLS here widens which COLUMNS of the
 * caller's own partner are legible; it must never widen WHICH partner row can
 * be selected. Do not feed client-supplied ids through this helper.
 *
 * SECOND CONSUMER (#3860): `services/recipientLocale.ts` wraps its `users` /
 * `organizations` / `partners` hops in ONE call. The escape is a generic
 * system-scope read, so it also lifts the dual-axis `users` policy (a
 * partner-staff recipient with `org_id IS NULL` is invisible to org scope);
 * the same "ids come from verified context only" obligation applies there.
 *
 * AVAILABILITY: the escape is taken ONLY when it is actually needed.
 * `withDbAccessContext` opens a real `baseDb.transaction`, pinning one pooled
 * connection for the whole callback, and `runOutsideDbContext` exits the
 * AsyncLocalStorage store — so the nested `withSystemDbAccessContext` does not
 * nest, it opens a SECOND transaction on a SECOND pooled connection while the
 * first is still held. A caller that is already system-scoped gains nothing
 * (partner-axis tables are fully visible to it) and would double-hold
 * connections against the 25-connection US ceiling, where postgres-js has no
 * acquire timeout. Same skip branch as `getEnrollmentDefaultsForOrg`
 * (services/enrollmentDefaults.ts, #2818).
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE SURVIVED #4673 W03, which deleted the config-policy sibling
 * (`withPartnerWideVisibility`): that sibling's rows are PARTNER-WIDE — they
 * live on org-axis tables with `org_id IS NULL`, so a SELECT-only RLS branch
 * (`org_id IS NULL AND partner_id = breeze_current_partner_id()`) can grant
 * them without touching write targeting. These rows are on PARTNER-AXIS tables
 * (`partners`, PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES): there is no `org_id IS NULL` shape to
 * key a branch on, and the only gate is `breeze_has_partner_access`, which also
 * governs WRITES. Granting it to org scope would widen UPDATE/DELETE, so the
 * escape stays until #2822 designs a read-only partner-axis branch. Do not
 * "clean this up" by analogy with W03.
