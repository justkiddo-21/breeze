 * write it describes.
 *
 * Keys must be in sentry.ts's ALLOWED_TAG_NAMES or they are dropped twice over
 * (setCallerTags at capture time, pickAllowedTags in the beforeSend scrubber);
 * values must stay low-cardinality and free of tenant/row identifiers.

 * Run a write that MUST move ≥1 row (use `.returning()`) and surface a 0-row
 * result as a Sentry warning (#1379 A2). Catches an RLS regression that lets
 * the context wrapper through but still denies the row — the #1375 class, at
 * the call-site. Opt-in and non-throwing: zero false positives, only wrap
 * sites you KNOW must affect a row (never idempotent upserts).
 *
 * The label is emitted as the `cas_label` tag, not just inside the message:
 * scrubEvent deletes `message`/`logentry`/`extra` before the event leaves the
 * process, so tags are the only channel that survives — without it every call
 * site collapses into one untriageable Sentry bucket (BREEZE-X).
