/**
 * Audit-Log Retention Worker (Task 29; hardened for issue #915)
 *
 * Walks `audit_retention_policies` daily and deletes `audit_logs` rows
 * older than each policy's `retention_days`.
 *
 * SECURE PATH (AUDIT_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL set, post-#915):
 *   The DELETE runs on a *dedicated* pool that logs in directly as the
 *   `breeze_audit_admin` role (db/auditAdminPool.ts). That role holds the
 *   DELETE privilege; the main `breeze_app` pool does not and — once
 *   `breeze_audit_admin` is REVOKEd from `breeze_app` — cannot acquire it.
 *   Only the trigger-bypass GUC (layer 2 below) is still set; no SET ROLE
 *   is needed because the connection already *is* the admin role. This is
 *   the privilege-separation fix: an attacker inside the API process,
 *   holding only a breeze_app connection, can no longer delete audit rows.
 *
 * LEGACY FALLBACK (AUDIT_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL unset, pre-#915 behavior):
 *   The DELETE runs on the shared breeze_app pool and defeats the
 *   append-only protections via two stacked layers (both required):
 *
 *     1. `SET LOCAL ROLE breeze_audit_admin` — breeze_app is a member of
 *        the role (migration 2026-05-25-i), so a SET LOCAL ROLE inside the
 *        transaction clears the privilege check.
 *     2. `SET LOCAL breeze.allow_audit_retention = '1'` — the
 *        `audit_log_immutable` trigger refuses every DELETE unless this
 *        session GUC is '1'.
 *
 *   This mode is reachable from the breeze_app connection (issue #915) and
 *   logs a loud startup warning. Existing deploys keep working here until
 *   they provision AUDIT_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL.
 *
 * In BOTH paths the trigger still requires `breeze.allow_audit_retention`:
 *
 * Per-policy transaction isolation: each policy runs in its own
 * `withSystemDbAccessContext` so a failure deleting for one org does
 * not abort the whole job. Postgres aborts the current transaction on
 * SQL error ("current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until
 * end of transaction block"), so a single outer transaction would
 * cascade-fail the entire pass.
 *
 * Idempotent for orgs that finished: re-running the same day matches zero
 * rows once an org's whole expired prefix is gone. An org that stopped at the
 * AUDIT_RETENTION_MAX_BATCHES ceiling is deliberately NOT idempotent — the
 * next run (same day or not) continues its prefix. See `orgsWithBacklog`.
 *
 * Scale (issue #4239): the prefix bound is an ordered early-stop
 * (`ORDER BY chain_seq LIMIT 1`) rather than a `MIN()` over a full join,
 * and the deletes run in bounded `LIMIT` batches (AUDIT_RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE
 * / AUDIT_RETENTION_MAX_BATCHES), matching the sibling retention jobs. The
 * reporter of #4239 observed the previous shape planning as a per-policy Seq
 * Scan of `audit_logs` on their ~17.8M-row tables, so each policy cost the
 * same regardless of org size. Those numbers are REPORTED, not reproduced
 * here — see the detail in `deleteChainPrefix`.
 *
 * Schedule: daily at 03:30 UTC, half-hour offset from oauthCleanup
 * (03:00 UTC) so the two crons don't pile onto the same minute.
 *
 * Kill switch: `AUDIT_RETENTION_ENABLED=false` skips schedule
 * registration without disabling the worker (so manual `add()` calls
 * for incident response still drain).

  // older than the cutoff — everything below the first "young" row in chain
  // order — either the maximal such prefix or as much of it as the per-run
  // batch ceiling allows (see MAX_BATCHES).
  //
  // Old stragglers sitting behind a young row survive until that BLOCKER itself
  // ages past the cutoff, which can be up to a full `retention_days` later —
  // not "one extra cycle", and on a busy org the blocker is continuously
  // replaced. Worth stating plainly: this job is compliance-facing and those
  // rows are expired-but-retained the whole time.
  //
  // No re-anchor follows: audit_log_verify_chain treats the first surviving
  // entry's prev_chain_checksum as the trusted anchor (it references the
  // legitimately pruned prefix), so retention never UPDATEs the chain — or
  // audit_logs — at all. The FK ON DELETE CASCADE removes the pruned rows'
  // chain entries; their BEFORE DELETE trigger passes because both call paths
  // set breeze.allow_audit_retention='1' SET LOCAL before calling this.

  // Step 1 — the prefix bound, hoisted out of the DELETE and rewritten as an
  // ordered early-stop (issue #4239). The old form was `MIN(c2.chain_seq)` over
  // the same filtered join. MIN has to consume the WHOLE join before it can
  // answer, and because the arm never constrains `a2.org_id`,
  // `audit_logs_org_timestamp_idx (org_id, timestamp DESC)` cannot apply.
  //
  // REPORTED (issue #4239, external operator on a self-hosted single-node PG16
  // with ~14 policies — NOT reproduced on our infrastructure, we have no
  // dataset at that scale): at ~17.8M rows the planner chose a Seq Scan of
  // audit_logs hash joined to a Seq Scan of audit_log_chain — ~200s and
  // ~1.94M shared-buffer block reads (~14.8 GiB, some possibly OS-cache hits)
  // for ONE org's cutoff, repeated per policy.
  //
  // `ORDER BY c2.chain_seq LIMIT 1` returns the identical value (the smallest
  // chain_seq in the same filtered set, or NULL) — a pure plan change, not a
  // semantic one, and it does not depend on timestamps being monotonic in chain
  // order. The LIMIT is what makes an ordered index path cheap to the planner,
  // so it can walk audit_log_chain in ascending chain_seq order, PK-probe
  // audit_logs per candidate, and stop at the FIRST young row.
  //
  // CAVEAT — not verified at production scale. Locally at 270k rows the planner
  // took audit_log_chain_pkey with an org_id filter (an early stop, but in
  // GLOBAL chain order, so the walk covers other orgs' interleaved rows too).
  // #4239 reports that at ~17.8M rows the planner rejects
  // audit_log_chain_org_seq_idx for this join because it is not covering
  // (audit_id is absent) — that was measured on the MIN/hash-join shape, which
  // has no LIMIT to make an index path attractive, so it does not transfer
  // directly. Still, an early stop is not guaranteed: a Sort over a Seq Scan
  // would satisfy the ORDER BY while consuming everything. If #4239 recurs, the
  // reporter's direction 2 (denormalised `logged_at` plus
  // `(org_id, chain_seq) INCLUDE (logged_at, audit_id)`) is the follow-up. The
  // batching in step 2 bounds the DELETE either way.
  //
  // WHY HOISTING THE CUTOFF IS SAFE (load-bearing dependency — read before
  // changing either side). The bound is computed once, then reused by DELETEs in
  // LATER statements, each of which takes a fresh READ COMMITTED snapshot. That
  // is only sound because `audit_log_seal_one`
  // (migrations/2026-06-11-h-audit-chain-seal-and-verify.sql:45) takes
  // `pg_advisory_xact_lock(1000200, hashtext(org_id))` BEFORE allocating
  // chain_seq, from a DEFERRED constraint trigger, so the lock is held from
  // allocation through commit. Per org that makes chain_seq allocation order
  // identical to commit-visibility order: a row committing between our cutoff
  // read and a later batch necessarily has chain_seq above everything we could
  // see, so it can never fall inside `chain_seq < cutoffSeq` and be swept into
  // the prefix. If that advisory lock is ever relaxed, this hoist becomes unsafe
  // and the bound must move back inside each DELETE.
  //
  // (`now()` is transaction_timestamp(), and every batch runs in the one per-org
  // transaction, so the time reference is stable across batches too.)
