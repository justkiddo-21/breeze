/**
 * Enrollment Key Cleanup Worker
 *
 * Part of the enrollment-key cleanup work (#2196). Task 1 added an on-demand
 * `POST /enrollment-keys/purge-expired` route that purges immediately-expired
 * keys within the caller's tenant scope (see `routes/enrollmentKeys.ts`).
 * This worker complements that route with a system-wide scheduled sweep: it
 * hard-deletes `enrollment_keys` rows that expired more than
 * `ENROLLMENT_KEY_PURGE_AFTER_DAYS` days ago (default 7), across all
 * partners/orgs, so the table doesn't grow unbounded from routine installer
 * churn even when nobody calls the manual purge route.
 *
 * Hard delete is safe: `installer_bootstrap_tokens` and `deployment_invites`
 * both carry `ON DELETE CASCADE` against `enrollment_keys`. Keys with
 * `expires_at IS NULL` never satisfy the `lt` condition below and are
 * therefore never deleted (explicit `isNotNull` guard makes that intent
 * unambiguous rather than relying only on SQL NULL comparison semantics).
 *
 * Exemption for live installer tokens (#2775): the Add Device modal's parent
 * enrollment key is a deliberately transient 60-minute container (PR #739
 * review finding #1), while the installer_bootstrap_token minted from it can
 * carry its own independent TTL of up to a year (routes/installer.ts no
 * longer clamps the child enrollment key to the parent's expiry). Without an
 * exemption here, this sweep would hard-delete that parent ~7 days after its
 * own 60-minute expiry — and the CASCADE above would take every outstanding
 * bootstrap token down with it, silently discarding an admin's 30-day/1-year
 * selection. The WHERE clause below therefore additionally requires that no
 * `installer_bootstrap_tokens` row referencing the key is still live (its own
 * `expires_at` in the future) AND unexhausted (`consumed_count < max_usage`);
 * such a key is left for a later sweep, once its last token has expired or
 * been fully consumed. The predicate itself lives in
 * `services/enrollmentKeyPurgeGuards.ts` because the on-demand purge route
 * named above needs the identical guard (#2832) — it was missed there for two
 * releases while it lived inline here.
 *
 * Scheduling:
 *   - Repeat cron: 04:00 UTC daily (pattern "0 4 * * *")
 *   - `jobId: 'enrollment-key-cleanup'` dedupes the repeatable job across
 *     multiple API replicas — BullMQ will only let one replica claim the
 *     scheduled job at each fire time.
 *
 * Env flags:
 *   - `ENROLLMENT_KEY_CLEANUP_ENABLED` defaults to ON. Operators can set it
 *     to `false` / `0` to disable scheduling in an emergency without a code
 *     deploy. The worker is still initialized (so the queue is reachable for
 *     manual `add()` calls), but no repeatable job is registered.
 *   - `ENROLLMENT_KEY_PURGE_AFTER_DAYS` — integer grace period (days) past
 *     expiry before a key is purged. Default 7.
 *
 * Partner API idempotency claims:
 *   - The same sweep reaps `partner_enrollment_key_idempotency`, the durable
 *     claim table behind `X-Idempotency-Key` on
 *     `POST /partner-api/v1/enrollment-keys`. A claim only has to outlive the
 *     window in which a client may retry, not the key it minted, so rows older
 *     than `PARTNER_ENROLLMENT_KEY_IDEMPOTENCY_RETENTION_DAYS` are deleted.
 *     Without this the table grows unbounded until org erasure: the FK cascade
 *     from `enrollment_keys` only clears claims whose key was itself purged,
 *     and a claim can outlive its key's own retention or have no key at all
 *     (a request that died between claim and commit).
 *   - The scan path is `partner_enrollment_key_idempotency_created_at_idx`.
 *   - Retention is a constant, not an operator knob: it is not a security
 *     bound, and a shorter window only means a very late retry mints a second
 *     key rather than replaying.
 *
 * Idempotency:
 *   - Two `DELETE ... WHERE` statements; running twice in one window simply
 *     finds zero matching rows the second time. Safe to retry on failure.
 *
 * RLS:
 *   - Background jobs have no request-scoped AsyncLocalStorage context, so
 *     the delete is wrapped in `withSystemDbAccessContext` here — the sweep
 *     operates at system scope (no tenant filter), matching the intent of
 *     purging expired keys across all partners.
