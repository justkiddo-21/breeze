/**
 * Metric Anomaly Incident Retention Worker
 *
 * BullMQ worker that prunes `metric_anomaly_incidents` rows once they have
 * reached a terminal dispatch state, in bounded ctid batches (#4210,
 * follow-up to #3828 / PRs #4195 #4203). Before this job,
 * `metric_anomaly_incidents` accumulated every collapsed anomaly incident
 * forever — `metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts` drains rows within seconds,
 * but nothing ever deleted the drained rows, so the table (and its indexes)
 * grew without bound and org erasure had to walk an ever-larger table for no
 * operational benefit.
 *
 * A row is terminal — and therefore eligible for pruning — in exactly two
 * cases, mirroring `metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts`'s own claim query:
 *
 *  - DISPATCHED: `dispatched_at IS NOT NULL`. Cutoff is measured from
 *    `dispatched_at` — the row has done its job.
 *  - PERMANENTLY FAILED: still undispatched but `dispatch_attempts` has
 *    exceeded `metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.MAX_PUBLISH_ATTEMPTS` — the
 *    publisher itself has given up retrying these (see that file's
 *    stuck-row alarm) and will never touch them again. Cutoff is measured
 *    from `created_at` since there is no `dispatched_at` to measure from.
 *
 * A row that is neither (undispatched, attempts still within budget) is
 * never touched, regardless of age — it may still be dispatched on the next
 * publisher pass. `lastSeenAt` is deliberately NOT the cutoff column: the
 * detector's re-upsert refreshes `lastSeenAt` on every conflict without
 * touching `dispatchedAt` (see the schema's doc comment), so an incident
 * that keeps recurring would never age out on `lastSeenAt` even after it has
 * long since been dispatched and read.
 *
 * Default retention: 14 days (configurable via
 * METRIC_ANOMALY_INCIDENT_RETENTION_DAYS, clamped to 1..365). Batch bounds:
 * METRIC_ANOMALY_INCIDENT_RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE /
 * METRIC_ANOMALY_INCIDENT_RETENTION_MAX_BATCHES.

/**
 * The core sweep, factored out of the BullMQ processor so integration tests
 * can invoke it directly against a real DB without going through Redis/BullMQ
 * (same shape as `mlOutputRetention.ts`'s `pruneMlOutputs` — see
 * `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/outboxRetention.integration.test.ts`).
 *
 * Two SEPARATE `pruneInCtidBatches` passes, not one OR'd predicate: a
 * permanently-failed (stuck) row is the only surviving evidence that an
 * anomaly incident never reached a subscriber —
 * `metricAnomalyIncidentPublisher.ts`'s own alarm scan reads exactly this
 * set. Folding both branches into one DELETE would report a single
 * aggregate count with no way to tell "N drained rows" from "N incidents
 * that never dispatched" (the same forensic-trail concern CLAUDE.md
 * codifies for migration cleanup DELETEs). Splitting costs one extra
 * (usually zero-row) DELETE per run — cheap at this table's volume — and
 * buys a `console.warn` the moment stuck rows are ever non-zero.
 *
 * No context wrapper here: pruneInCtidBatches opens one per batch, so that
 * each batch commits and releases its locks (see retentionBatch.ts).
