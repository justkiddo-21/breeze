/**
 * Accounting Sync Worker
 *
 * BullMQ worker for QuickBooks invoice push/void side effects (Phase C, Task 4
 * — .superpowers/sdd/2026-09-01-quickbooks-phase-c-invoice-push/task-4-brief.md).
 * Fired from `invoiceService.ts`'s issue/void post-commit hooks, this is the
 * ONLY caller of `pushInvoiceToAccounting`/`voidInvoiceInAccounting`
 * (`accountingInvoicePush.ts`) that runs off the request path.
 *
 * Mirrors `invoiceWorker.ts` (queue singleton, discriminated job data,
 * exported handler for direct unit testing, createXWorker, initialize/
 * shutdown pair). The coordinator does NOT self-wrap in a DB context and must
 * be entered with none open, so this worker runs `runOutsideDbContext` around
 * the job and hands the coordinator a SYSTEM-context runner it re-enters per
 * phase — never one context wrapped around the whole job.
 *
 * Retry taxonomy (keys on `AccountingInvoicePushError.code` — a fixed
 * `TERMINAL_CODES` allowlist below, NOT the HTTP `.status`: `invoice_not_pushable`
 * alone carries both 404 (unknown invoice) and 409 (draft/void), so "terminal
 * = 404/409" would be inaccurate shorthand for how the match actually works):
 *   - TERMINAL (logged, no rethrow — BullMQ marks the job complete): every
 *     code in `TERMINAL_CODES` — `invoice_not_pushable`, `customer_not_mapped`,
 *     `home_currency_unknown`, `currency_mismatch`,
 *     `customer_currency_mismatch`, `dependency_not_ready`, `not_connected`,
 *     `reauth_required`, `void_blocked_by_payments` (each a 404 or 409 — see
 *     the codes' own status in `accountingInvoicePush.ts`; the last one is
 *     QuickBooks refusing to void an invoice a Payment settles there, a rule
 *     that answers the same on every attempt — #5180) PLUS `record_failed` (502 — the remote
 *     QuickBooks write already landed; only the local persist failed, so
 *     retrying would create a duplicate invoice in QuickBooks, not fix
 *     anything). Retrying any of these can never succeed: the mapping row
 *     already carries the error for an operator/route to see and act on.
 *   - RETRYABLE (rethrown so BullMQ's attempts/backoff fires): `quickbooks_error`
 *     (502 — a genuine QuickBooks/network failure), `sync_in_progress` (409 —
 *     a void raced a push that has not recorded its remote id yet), and any
 *     error that is not a typed `AccountingInvoicePushError` at all. The provider sends a
 *     deterministic QBO `requestid` on invoice CREATE (Task 3), so a retried
 *     create after a timeout is idempotent on the QuickBooks side.
 *
 * PAYMENT jobs (Phase D2 — `push-payment`/`delete-payment`) run the same
 * two-lane taxonomy against `AccountingPaymentPushError.code`, via the
 * separate `PAYMENT_TERMINAL_CODES` set below: `push_disabled`,
 * `customer_not_mapped`, `home_currency_unknown`, `currency_mismatch`,
 * `invoice_void`, `record_failed`, `not_connected` and `reauth_required` are
 * terminal; `quickbooks_error`, `sync_in_progress` and `invoice_not_synced`
 * (plus any non-typed error) are retryable. Unlike invoice jobs, the
 * `pushMode` gate does NOT apply to payment jobs — see the handler below.
