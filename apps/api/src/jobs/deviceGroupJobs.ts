/**
 * Dynamic device-group membership re-evaluation queue (#4630).
 *
 * WHY A QUEUE. The request handlers that observe a device attribute change
 * (agent heartbeat, agent enrollment, device provisioning) all run inside
 * `withDbAccessContext`, which is a real `baseDb.transaction(...)` holding a
 * pooled Postgres connection. Re-evaluating group membership inline there is
 * unbounded work — one SELECT + filter evaluation per dynamic group in the
 * org, plus an INSERT/DELETE, a membership-log write and a peripheral-policy
 * enqueue (2-3 Redis round trips) per membership flip — all while the
 * heartbeat's `UPDATE devices` row lock is still held. That is exactly the
 * pool-starvation shape of the 09-03 US incident, on the highest-volume
 * endpoint in the product.
 *
 * So the request side does nothing but hand the device id to this queue, and
 * a worker does the evaluation afterwards, off the request's connection:
 *
 *   - Coalesced per device under a fixed `jobId` (`group-reeval-<deviceId>`),
 *     the same shape `jobs/peripheralJobs.ts` uses for
 *     `policy-reconciliation-<deviceId>`. A device that flaps hostname three
 *     times in one second re-evaluates once, with the union of the changed
 *     fields — a burst can never fan out into a burst of evaluations.
 *   - `requestDeviceGroupReevaluation` is FIRE-AND-FORGET on purpose: it
 *     returns a promise the caller must not await, so not even the enqueue's
 *     own Redis round trips happen while the request transaction is open, and
 *     a Redis outage can never turn into a failed heartbeat. It touches no
 *     Postgres connection, so unlike a detached DB call it cannot be stranded
 *     on a committed transaction (the #3182 materialization bug).
 *   - Every job is DELAYED by `DEVICE_GROUP_REEVALUATION_DELAY_MS` so it cannot
 *     run before the enqueuing request's transaction commits — the worker reads
 *     on a different connection and would otherwise see a snapshot without the
 *     device row (enrollment) or with the pre-UPDATE hostname (heartbeat). See
 *     that constant for the full failure mode.
 *   - The worker wraps the evaluation in `withSystemDbAccessContext` and
 *     re-reads the device's OWN org id from the database rather than trusting
 *     the job payload, so a stale or forged payload can never steer an
 *     evaluation at another tenant's groups. Without a DB access context the
 *     forced-RLS `breeze_app` role returns zero rows from every SELECT, which
 *     would make the whole evaluation a silent no-op.

/**
 * How long a re-evaluation job waits before it becomes runnable.
 *
 * THIS IS A CORRECTNESS CONSTANT, not a throttle. Every caller enqueues from
 * INSIDE its own still-open `withDbAccessContext` / `withSystemDbAccessContext`
 * transaction (that is the whole point — the enqueue must not wait on, or run
 * after, the request's DB work). The worker opens its OWN transaction on a
 * different pooled connection, so without a delay it races the caller's COMMIT
 * and can read a snapshot in which the device row does not exist yet:
 *
 *   - enrollment/provision: `INSERT INTO devices` has not committed, so the
 *     processor's SELECT finds nothing and returns `{evaluated: false}` — a
 *     "successful" job that never evaluates the device, and since nothing
 *     threw, nothing retries. The device is never added to any dynamic group.
 *     The window is wide: `/enroll` awaits mTLS certificate issuance AFTER the
 *     enqueue.
 *   - heartbeat: the row exists but the SELECT reads the PRE-`UPDATE` hostname,
 *     so the filter flip the job was queued for is invisible.
 *
 * 5s is far longer than any of these handlers' remaining work, and the cost is
 * only that dynamic membership lags a device change by ~5s. Coalescing is
 * unaffected: `delayed` is in `isReusableState` (services/bullmqUtils.ts), so a
 * second change to the same device inside the window still merges into the
 * waiting job rather than adding a duplicate — and, usefully, the whole delay
 * window becomes a coalescing window for a flapping device.
