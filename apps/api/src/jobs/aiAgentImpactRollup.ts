/**
 * AI Agent Impact Rollup Worker (Phase 2 wave P2-6, #4193 task A5).
 *
 * Nightly producer + per-org fan-out for `ai_agent_impact_daily`, the
 * value-accounting rollup the Impact page reads. Shape mirrors
 * `jobs/metricRollups.ts` and `jobs/aiAgentSweepScheduler.ts`: one BullMQ
 * queue, two job shapes —
 *
 *  - `scan` — a repeatable job on the registry-allocated daily slot
 *    (`scheduleRegistry.ts`, `'ai-agent-impact-rollup'`). Finds every org
 *    with ANY impact-relevant fact in the last `IMPACT_NIGHTLY_TRAILING_DAYS`
 *    complete UTC days and enqueues one `rebuild-org-range` job per org —
 *    the trailing 7-day window for an already-bootstrapped org, or the full
 *    `AI_AGENT_IMPACT_REBUILD_DAYS` (90-day) window the first time an org is
 *    seen, so a brand-new org's page is not truthfully-but-uselessly all
 *    zero until 90 nightly passes fill it in one day at a time.
 *
 *  - `rebuild-org-range` — one `rebuildOrgImpactRange(orgId, fromDay, toDay)`
 *    call. Deterministic jobId (`buildImpactRollupJobId`) makes a duplicate
 *    enqueue for the same (org, range) a natural BullMQ no-op while the
 *    first is still waiting/delayed/active — this is what makes the manual
 *    `POST /ai/agents/impact/rebuild` endpoint safe to call repeatedly.
 *
 * Per-org error boundary (fix round 1, review finding): `processImpactScan`
 * wraps each org's bootstrap-check + job-spec build in its own try/catch,
 * exactly like `jobs/aiAgentSweepScheduler.ts:256-303`'s per-baseline
 * boundary — "One partner must never be able to stop the scan for every
 * other partner". A single `needsImpactBootstrap` rejection (a bad row, a
 * transient DB blip) used to propagate out of the whole `for` loop before
 * `addBulk` ever ran, losing the night's rollup fleet-wide. The scan is a
 * once-a-day repeatable with no `attempts`/backoff (unlike the 5-minute
 * sweeper), so a lost pass here is a lost DAY, not a lost 5 minutes — the
 * boundary matters more here, not less.
 *
 * Manual-refresh dedup (fix round 1, review finding): `enqueueImpactRollupForOrgs`
 * (the `POST /ai/agents/impact/rebuild` producer) uses `enqueueOrReplaceStale`
 * (`services/bullmqUtils.ts`) instead of a bare `addBulk` with a fixed
 * `jobId`. BullMQ's jobId dedup keys on "a record with this id exists in
 * Redis", not "a job with this id is pending" — a completed job stays keyed
 * under its `jobId` for as long as `removeOnComplete` retains it, so a
 * second manual rebuild for the same (org, range) *after the first one
 * finished* was also silently swallowed: `addBulk` returned the stale
 * completed job, the route reported success, and nothing re-ran. This is
 * the exact hazard `bullmqUtils.ts`'s own docstring describes and
 * `jobs/tenantErasure.ts`/`jobs/orgMerge.ts` already fix the same way:
 * reuse a job that is genuinely still waiting/active/delayed (so a rapid
 * double-click on Refresh still coalesces into one run), remove-and-re-add
 * one that has already completed or failed. The nightly scan fan-out
 * in `processImpactScan` keeps the plain `addBulk` shape the task brief
 * specifies unchanged — `through` shifts every day, so the same-range
 * replay this hazard describes cannot happen there.
 *
 * No worker-level system DB context, deliberately. `rebuildOrgImpactRange`,
 * `findImpactSourceOrgIds` and `needsImpactBootstrap` (`services/aiAgents/
 * impactRollup.ts`) each own one short-lived LABELLED system context per
 * call, preceded by their own `runOutsideDbContext` escape — see that
 * module's header for why. Wrapping this worker's calls in an outer context
 * would not be joined (the escape defeats it); it would only pin a second
 * idle-in-transaction connection for the whole pass, exactly the
 * `alertWorker`/#3216 trap `jobs/metricRollups.ts:122-128` documents. The
 * `runOutsideDbContext` call below on the `rebuild-org-range` branch is the
 * same belt-and-braces precedent as that file's — against a future ambient
 * context on this path, not because one exists today.
 *
 * Producer gate: `processImpactScan` re-reads `envFlag('BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_ENABLED',
 * false)` at CALL time, never a module-scope const — same convention as
 * `aiAgentSweepScheduler.ts:247-252` — so flipping the flag resumes nightly
 * rollups without a process restart. No new env flag is introduced (spec
 * §7 / plan Deviation 7): this is the existing switch, read the same way.
