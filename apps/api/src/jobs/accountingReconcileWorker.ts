/**
 * Accounting Reconcile Worker (QuickBooks -> Breeze payment pull-back)
 *
 * Phase D, Task 4 —
 * `.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-02-quickbooks-phase-d-payment-pullback/task-4-brief.md`.
 *
 * Drains one QuickBooks CDC window per connection: `reconcileChanges` (Task 2)
 * reads everything that changed since the connection's `cdc_cursor`, and the
 * appliers in `accountingPaymentPull.ts` (Task 3) land each item. A 15-minute
 * repeatable `sweep` job fans out one `reconcile-connection` job per connection
 * with EITHER direction switch on (`pull_payments OR push_payments` — the push
 * side needs the CDC pass to adopt its own lost creates and to notice a
 * Breeze-created Payment deleted in QuickBooks); the QuickBooks webhook route enqueues the same job
 * shape with `trigger: 'webhook'`, and the "Sync now" route with
 * `trigger: 'manual'`.
 *
 * Structured on `accountingSyncWorker.ts` (queue singleton, discriminated job
 * data, handler exported for direct unit testing, createX/initialize/shutdown)
 * and on `huntressSync.ts:1108-1126` for the remove-then-add repeatable
 * registration.
 *
 * DB CONTEXT. Every Task-1/Task-3 entry point this module calls asserts it was
 * entered with NO ambient DB access context and takes a `DbContextRunner`
 * instead (`services/accounting/dbContextGuard.ts` — read its header). So the
 * job body runs under `runOutsideDbContext` and hands down a runner that opens
 * ONE SHORT system context per phase. Wrapping the whole job in a single
 * context would pin a pooled Postgres connection idle-in-transaction across
 * every QuickBooks round trip (#1105) AND turn each applier's sync-state write
 * into a savepoint that vanishes the moment anything downstream throws.
 *
 * DELETIONS BEFORE ADDITIONS (plan decision 4). Within one CDC window a
 * payment can be created and deleted, or an invoice deleted after a payment
 * landed against it. Processing deletions first means the window can only ever
 * converge on "deleted"; the reverse order would resurrect a row and then
 * delete it, or delete a row and then re-create it from the same window.
 *
 * RETRY TAXONOMY — the cursor is the whole point:
 *   - CLEAN (cursor advances, job completes): `applied`, `updated`,
 *     `replayed`, `reversed`, and the three RECORDED PERMANENT outcomes
 *     `skipped_unmapped`, `currency_mismatch` and `invoice_void`. The last
 *     three cannot be fixed by retrying — the divergence is already recorded
 *     on the mapping row for an operator — so holding the cursor for them
 *     would wedge the connection and re-report the same item every 15 minutes
 *     forever.
 *   - DIRTY (cursor is LEFT EXACTLY WHERE IT WAS and the job rethrows so
 *     BullMQ's attempts/backoff replays the whole window): any per-item
 *     `failed`, whether an applier threw or a reversal reported `failed`.
 *     Advancing past a failed item loses it permanently — nothing else ever
 *     re-reads that window. Replay is safe: the appliers are idempotent (the
 *     `(payment, invoice)` mapping claim is at-most-once and a reversal whose
 *     mapping row is already gone is a clean no-op).
 *   - HELD (cursor stays put, job COMPLETES): every run on a connection with
 *     `pull_payments` off. The pass ran only because `push_payments` is on and
 *     it skipped every QuickBooks-origin line, so advancing would make that
 *     suppression permanent — re-enabling pull would resume from a watermark
 *     that had already stepped over everything it never imported, and CDC
 *     cannot ask for a window again. `last_reconcile_at` IS stamped, so a held
 *     run does not read as a stalled connection.

 * switched-off connection, a lost connection, a stale job target and a
 * genuine connectivity problem were indistinguishable from the outside.
 *
 *   - `missing`: no QuickBooks connection exists for this partner at all.
 *   - `connection_mismatch`: a connection exists, but it is not the row this
 *     job named (the partner reconnected under a new connection id between
 *     enqueue and processing — the job's target is simply stale).
 *   - `not_connected`: the connection exists and matches, but its `status`
 *     is not `connected` (e.g. `reauth_required`, `error`).
 *   - `both_switches_off`: the connection is live and matches, but the
 *     operator has switched BOTH `pull_payments` and `push_payments` off.
 *     Phase D2 (spec decision 6): pull-off/push-on is NOT a skip — the CDC
 *     pass still runs because it is what ADOPTS a Breeze-created Payment
 *     whose phase 2 never landed and what notices a Breeze-origin Payment
 *     deleted in QuickBooks. In that window it touches Breeze-origin rows
 *     ONLY: every QuickBooks-origin line — a new import, an edit of one

 * `accounting_entity_mappings` row that still owes QuickBooks a push or a delete,
 * whose lease has expired (PAYMENT_CLAIM_LEASE_MS) and whose last update is
 * older than PAYMENT_SWEEP_MIN_AGE_MS — the grace window that keeps the sweep
 * from racing the enqueue the caller just made — is re-enqueued on the
 * accounting-sync queue. That is what makes a lost
 * enqueue — Redis down, the process dying between COMMIT and `add()`, BullMQ
 * exhausting its attempts — recover with no operator action.
 *
 * Pass 2 is deliberately NOT gated on any connection switch: a delete must
 * propagate even for a connection whose push is switched off, because Breeze
 * created that Payment in QuickBooks and owns its removal.
 *
 * Both passes read inside ONE short system context each, CLOSED before any Redis
 * work — an `add()` that blocks on a slow Redis must never hold a pooled
 * Postgres connection.
