/**
 * Quote delayed-send queue — the "Undo send" window.
 *
 * Clicking Send schedules the real dispatch as a delayed BullMQ job (default
 * 30s) instead of emailing immediately; the quote stays a DRAFT with
 * send_scheduled_at/send_job_id stamped so the UI shows "Sending in Ns — Undo"
 * and cancel can verify there is something to cancel. When the job fires it
 * runs the exact sendQuote pipeline a direct send uses (freeze, contract-var
 * gate, PDF, email, draft→sent) under a system DB context with the ORIGINAL
 * actor, so every app-layer access check still applies.
 *
 * Failure semantics are deliberately conservative — nothing is ever half-sent:
 * - sendQuote rejects at fire time (e.g. a contract variable was cleared
 *   during the window): the quote stays a DRAFT, the schedule is cleared, and
 *   send_email_reason is stamped 'send_failed' so the UI can show a persistent
 *   "scheduled send failed" banner — the user saw a success toast at schedule
 *   time and may be long gone, so an ephemeral signal is not enough.
 * - the job is lost entirely (Redis flush): nothing runs, so the stale
 *   schedule columns survive; the UI treats a past send_scheduled_at on a
 *   draft as "not scheduled" and restores the Send button.
 *
 * Ownership is an atomic DB claim on send_job_id (unique per schedule): the
 * worker, an undo, a reschedule, and a direct send each take the row's jobId
 * out from under the others with a conditional UPDATE, so exactly one of them
 * wins and the loser reliably no-ops. cancelQuoteSend answers from that claim
 * — never from the Redis remove result, which can't distinguish "window
 * elapsed" from "Redis down".
