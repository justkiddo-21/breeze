/**
 * Tenant Erasure Worker (Task 30 — GDPR org-wide erasure)
 *
 * Processes one job per platform-admin erasure request. Each job
 * payload is `{ orgId, performedBy, performedByEmail }` and the worker
 * invokes `cascadeDeleteOrg`. The route handler does NOT run the
 * cascade inline because:
 *   - Erasure can touch every device/agent_logs/etc. row for a tenant
 *     (potentially millions of rows). Doing it on the HTTP path holds
 *     the request open for minutes and is fragile to reverse-proxy
 *     timeouts.
 *   - Single-replica processing keeps the cascade serial across the
 *     fleet — two simultaneous erasures of different orgs are fine, but
 *     two erasures of the SAME org would compete for locks.
 *
 * No cron / no kill switch: this queue ONLY runs when a platform admin
 * POSTs to `/admin/tenant-erasure`. Jobs are uniquely identified by
 * `tenant-erasure-<orgId>` so a double-POST collapses to a single job.
 *
 * On failure: BullMQ's default retry is disabled here (`attempts: 1`)
 * because a partial-cascade re-run could hide a structural issue
 * (e.g. a new table added without cascade-list entry). We want the
 * job to fail loudly so on-call investigates manually. The audit log
 * records the failure with the partial-deletion state.

/**
 * Enqueue an erasure job. `jobId = tenant-erasure-<orgId>` so a double-POST,
 * or a sweeper re-enqueue for an erasure that was already handed off, coalesces
 * into the one job rather than running the cascade twice.
 *
 * CORRECTED (org-lifecycle Wave 2 final review): this used a bare `queue.add`,
 * and "BullMQ refuses to enqueue a duplicate" was doing more damage than the
 * old comment implied. `attempts: 1` is deliberate here — a failed erasure must
 * fail loudly for on-call — and `removeOnFail: { count: 50 }` keeps the failed
 * record for inspection. Together those meant a FAILED erasure permanently
 * suppressed every later enqueue for that org: the admin's retry and
 * `tenantOffboarding.ts`'s case-1 sweeper both silently no-opped, `add`
 * returned the dead job's id, and the tenant was never erased. For a GDPR
 * erasure path that is the worst possible way to fail — the retry mechanism
 * designed to catch it was itself the thing being swallowed.
 *
 * `enqueueOrReplaceStale` reuses a genuinely live job (so two erasures of the
 * same org still never compete for locks, which is the property the module
 * docstring above cares about) and replaces a spent one.
