/**
 * Pre-archive check for release builds of the Breeze RMM mobile app.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS SCRIPT IS NOT A GATE. Nothing invokes it — the mobile CI build
 * only compiles an unsigned Debug simulator app, and the real release path is
 * a human pressing Product → Archive in Xcode, which does not run it. That is
 * not a hypothetical weakness: this file's DSN check was correct for 90 days
 * while the breeze-mobile Sentry project recorded zero events, because nobody
 * ever ran it. A check that a human has to remember is not a check.
 *
 * The DSN and the API URL are therefore now enforced where they CANNOT be
 * skipped: `app.config.js` → `src/config/sentryDsn.js` and
 * `src/config/apiUrl.js`, evaluated by an expo-constants Xcode build phase on
 * every single build. Those two checks below are kept as a fast local echo of
 * the same failure, and the API URL one calls the very same rule function so
 * the two can never disagree — but neither is what protects a release any more.
 *
 * What this script is still uniquely worth running for is the auth token, which
 * has no equivalent build-time guard.
 *
 * Everything this guards is a SILENT failure: the app boots fine, passes review,
 * and only misbehaves in ways nobody can see from a TestFlight install.
 *
 *   - No Sentry DSN  → zero crash/error telemetry, and the app's many
 *     `captureMessage` calls for otherwise-invisible failures go nowhere.
 *     (Now also caught at build time; see above.)
 *   - localhost API  → every request fails on a real device.
 *     (Now also caught at build time; see above.)
 *
 * The Sentry auth token is the exception: a missing one is NOT silent, it fails
 * the Xcode Archive from inside a build phase. It is checked here anyway so the
 * problem surfaces in a terminal with a fixable message, rather than 10 minutes
 * into an archive as `error: sentry-cli`.
 *
 * Run before `expo prebuild` / Xcode Archive:  pnpm --filter breeze-mobile preflight
 *
 * Checks run only for release builds. Pass `--dev` (or set BREEZE_MOBILE_DEV=1)
 * to downgrade failures to warnings for a local build.
