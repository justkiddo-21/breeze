 * into the next session on the paths this set misses:
 *   - `auth/logout`            — synchronous reducer (e.g. RootNavigator on a 401)
 *   - `auth/logout/fulfilled`  — `logoutAsync` thunk, API logout succeeded
 *   - `auth/logout/rejected`   — `logoutAsync` thunk, API logout FAILED but the
 *                                rejected reducer still nulls user/token (and
 *                                queued secure wipe still runs), so the user
 *                                is signed out — e.g. the `device_blocked` /
 *                                network-failure path dispatched from RootNavigator.
 *
 * Keep this in lockstep with `authSlice`'s logout reducers. These are string
 * literals (not the thunk's generated `.type` constants) on purpose: this module
 * is deliberately RN-free so it can be unit-tested without importing the auth
 * slice, which pulls in expo-secure-store.
