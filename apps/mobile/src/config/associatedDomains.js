/**
 * Associated Domains resolution for self-hosted builds.
 *
 * `app.json` pins `ios.associatedDomains` to the two hosted regions, which is
 * right for the published App Store build but leaves self-hosters with no
 * domain-to-app association. Without it a saved password-manager entry does not
 * match the app, so the TOTP code is never suggested and has to be copied by
 * hand on every sign-in — painful against a 15-minute access token.
 *
 * Apple binds Associated Domains into the signed entitlement, so this cannot be
 * a runtime setting. It is resolved when the app is built: `BREEZE_ASSOCIATED_DOMAINS`
 * is merged into the static list so someone building from source can cover
 * their own server.
 *
 * Two deliberate restrictions, because the output lands in a SIGNED entitlement:
 *
 *  - Only `webcredentials:` is emitted. Accepting arbitrary service prefixes
 *    would let a build-time env var widen the entitlement into `applinks:`
 *    (which changes universal-link routing) for no benefit to this feature.
 *  - Input is validated and a bad entry THROWS. Silently skipping junk is worse
 *    than failing: the build succeeds, the entitlement is missing the domain,
 *    and the operator has no idea until autofill quietly does not work.
 *
 * Deliberately plain CommonJS, not TypeScript: `app.config.js` is loaded by
 * Expo through a bare `require`, and while Expo transpiles the config file
 * itself it does NOT transpile modules the config imports. A `.ts` module here
 * fails at `expo config`/`expo prebuild` time with "Cannot find module".
