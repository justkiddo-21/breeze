/**
 * The client's mirror of the server's ticket-attachment contract: limits,
 * shapes, error codes and the user-facing copy for each.
 *
 * **This module imports nothing native, and must stay that way.** Its sibling
 * `ticketAttachments.ts` pulls in `expo-image-picker`, `expo-file-system` and
 * friends, which transitively load `react-native/index.js` — Flow-typed source
 * that Vitest cannot parse. `apps/mobile/vitest.config.ts` therefore restricts
 * the suite to `.ts` and warns that component imports must never drag RN into
 * the runner. Splitting the pure half out is what lets composer and feed logic
 * be tested without mocking six Expo modules to reach a constant.
 *
 * Limits are duplicated from `packages/shared/src/constants/ticketAttachments.ts`
 * rather than imported, because `apps/mobile` has no `@breeze/shared`
 * dependency and Metro resolves no workspace packages here —
 * `services/tickets.ts` mirrors `TICKET_STATUS_TRANSITIONS` the same way. The
 * server re-validates every value, so this copy is a UX shortcut (fail before
 * spending the upload), never the enforcement point.
