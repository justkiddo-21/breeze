 * Double-submit CSRF token handling for the native client.
 *
 * The server issues a random CSRF token as a NON-HttpOnly cookie
 * (`breeze_csrf_token`) alongside the HttpOnly refresh cookie, and expects the
 * same value echoed in the `x-breeze-csrf` header. `validateCookieCsrfRequest`
 * only accepts the literal `1` when the CSRF cookie is ABSENT — a compatibility
 * path for clients with no cookie access.
 *
 * React Native's networking layer keeps its own cookie store, so once login has
 * happened the cookie IS sent back. A client that keeps sending `1` then fails
 * the `safeCompareTokens` branch and every refresh is rejected, which ends the
 * session as soon as the access token expires.
 *
 * The cookie is deliberately not HttpOnly, so the correct fix is to read it
 * from the login response and echo the real value. This module owns that token.
