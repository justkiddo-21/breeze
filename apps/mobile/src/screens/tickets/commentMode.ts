 *     (`apps/api/src/jobs/ticketNotifyWorker.ts:491`, the
 *     `event.payload.isPublic && !event.payload.inbound` branch). The mail is
 *     already gone by the time the technician notices. There is no recall, and
 *     deleting the comment does not unsend it.
 *
 *   - Wrong on the internal side: the note is invisible to the customer until
 *     someone re-posts it as a reply. Cost: one extra tap.
 *
 * A phone is where the mis-tap happens — one-handed, in a van, on a screen with
 * no hover state and no undo — so the safe default belongs here even though the
 * desk-bound web app can reasonably keep the other one. Flip this single
 * constant if that judgement ever changes; nothing else encodes the default.
