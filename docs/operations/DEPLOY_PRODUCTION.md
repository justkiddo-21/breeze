# Production Deployment (One Command)

This guide deploys Breeze with TLS, hardened container settings, monitoring, and logging using:

- `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `scripts/prod/deploy.sh`

## Which deploy path?

Breeze ships two Compose configurations:

| Path | Files | When to use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Simple self-host** | `docker-compose.yml` + `.env.example` (repo root) | Single-host self-hosted deploys behind your own TLS reverse proxy. Tag-pinned images by default (override with digests for higher assurance). Uses the `*_IMAGE_REF` variable schema. |
| **Strict production** *(this doc)* | `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` + `deploy/.env.example` | Production rollouts with Cloudflare Tunnel, hardened ACLs, monitoring/logging, and **mandatory** digest-pinned images. Uses the `*_IMAGE_DIGEST` variable schema (Breeze images) and `*_IMAGE_REF` (third-party). The hardening check (`scripts/security/check-supply-chain-hardening.sh`) refuses to ship a release with mutable tags in this path. |

The two paths use **different variable names** intentionally — they are not interchangeable. If you copied `.env` from one path, do not point it at the other Compose file.

## Prerequisites

- Linux host with Docker Engine + Docker Compose plugin
- Node.js 20+ and `pnpm` (for running DB migrations from source)
- DNS `A/AAAA` record for your domain pointing to the host
- Ports `80` and `443` open to the internet (for ACME + HTTPS)

## 1) Prepare Environment

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example .env.prod
```

Set at least these values in `.env.prod`:

- `BREEZE_DOMAIN`
- `ACME_EMAIL`
- `BREEZE_VERSION`
- `BREEZE_API_IMAGE_DIGEST`
- `BREEZE_WEB_IMAGE_DIGEST`
- `BREEZE_BINARIES_IMAGE_DIGEST`
- `CADDY_IMAGE_REF`
- `CLOUDFLARED_IMAGE_REF`
- `REDIS_IMAGE_REF`
- `COTURN_IMAGE_REF`
- `BILLING_IMAGE_REF`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `AGENT_ENROLLMENT_SECRET`
- `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `ENROLLMENT_KEY_PEPPER`
- `MFA_RECOVERY_CODE_PEPPER`
- `RELEASE_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEYS`
- `BREEZE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` (first boot only, when the users table is empty)
- `BREEZE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (first boot only; generate a one-time value with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `METRICS_SCRAPE_TOKEN`
- `PUBLIC_API_URL` (example: `https://app.example.com/api/v1`)
- `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_EXPORTER_DSN` (required when the monitoring overlay is enabled — `ENABLE_MONITORING=true`, the default for `scripts/prod/deploy.sh`; this stack has no local `postgres` service, so point it at the same managed database as `DATABASE_URL`, in `postgres_exporter`'s DSN form: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=require`)

### Obtaining image digests

`BREEZE_*_IMAGE_DIGEST` values are `sha256:<64hex>` strings — not full image refs. The Compose file prepends `ghcr.io/lanternops/breeze/<name>@` automatically.

```bash
# Replace 0.67.1 with the release you intend to deploy.
TAG=0.67.1
for img in api web portal binaries; do
  digest=$(docker buildx imagetools inspect "ghcr.io/lanternops/breeze/$img:$TAG" \
    --format '{{json .Manifest}}' | jq -r .digest)
  echo "BREEZE_${img^^}_IMAGE_DIGEST=$digest"
done
```

Third-party `*_IMAGE_REF` values are full digest-pinned refs (`name@sha256:<64hex>`):

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect caddy:2-alpine \
  --format 'caddy@{{json .Manifest | fromjson | .digest}}' | tr -d '"'
```

The bootstrap admin password is not logged by the API. If these values are missing on first boot against an empty production database, the API refuses to seed a default admin. After the initial admin signs in and completes setup, remove `BREEZE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `BREEZE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the production environment.

Production compose intentionally does not run Watchtower or mount the Docker socket. Rollouts should be done by updating the digest-pinned image values above and running the deploy script through the normal release process.

## 2) Deploy

```bash
./scripts/prod/deploy.sh .env.prod
```

What the script does:

1. Validates required env vars and digest-pinned image refs.
2. Validates the production Compose configuration.
3. Starts Redis and waits for readiness.
4. Runs `pnpm db:migrate` against `DATABASE_URL`.
5. Starts the full stack (edge, app, billing, monitoring, Loki/Promtail).
6. Runs smoke checks.

## 3) Verify

- App: `https://<BREEZE_DOMAIN>/health`
- API through edge: `https://<BREEZE_DOMAIN>/api/v1/alerts` (auth required)
- Customer portal: `https://<BREEZE_DOMAIN>/portal/login` (renders the portal login)
- Grafana (local bind): `http://127.0.0.1:${GRAFANA_PORT:-3000}`
- Prometheus (local bind): `http://127.0.0.1:${PROMETHEUS_PORT:-9090}`

You can also run:

```bash
./scripts/ops/verify-monitoring.sh .env.prod
```

## 4) Notes

- `redis` is not host-published. `prometheus`, `grafana`, `alertmanager`, `loki`, and `promtail` bind to `127.0.0.1` only.
- Public ingress is only through Caddy on `80/443`.
- In Cloudflare Tunnel mode, Caddy trusts client-IP headers only from the configured `BREEZE_CLOUDFLARED_IP`, and the API trusts forwarded headers only from `BREEZE_CADDY_IP`. Keep `CADDY_TRUSTED_PROXIES` and `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` pinned to exact proxy hops, not broad private ranges.
- **An exact-host `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` pin REQUIRES the proxy container to have a static IP.** Docker bridge IPs are not stable across container recreates, so a `/32` pin is only safe when the proxy service is given a fixed `ipv4_address` on the compose network — `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` already does this for Caddy (`ipv4_address: ${BREEZE_CADDY_IP:-172.30.0.11}`, matching the default `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` pin). If you recreate containers **without** a static proxy IP, the pin goes stale and client-IP attribution breaks **silently**: the API (correctly) stops trusting forwarded headers, every per-IP rate limit pools all clients onto the proxy's IP (mass 429s under aggregate load), and audit logs record the proxy IP as every client's source address. The API now detects this at runtime — watch for `[proxy-trust] MISCONFIGURATION` warnings in the API logs and the `breeze_proxy_trust_untrusted_peer_total` Prometheus counter; both should stay at zero in a healthy deployment.
- Container resource limits, restart policies, and no-new-privileges are configured in prod compose.
- **Customer portal (`apps/portal`)** runs as its own `portal` service and is served under the
  `/portal` path prefix on the main domain — no dedicated hostname, DNS record, or TLS cert is required.
  Caddy routes `/portal/*` to `portal:4322` (ahead of the web catch-all); the portal calls the API
  same-origin via `/api/*`, so there is no CORS surface. The base path is baked into the portal
  image at build time (`PORTAL_BASE_PATH`, default `/portal`) — changing it requires an image rebuild,
  and the Caddyfile carve-out + `PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL` must stay in sync. `PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL`
  (default `https://<BREEZE_DOMAIN>/portal`) is what the API uses to mint customer-facing links
  (e.g. quote acceptance emails). Per-org custom portal domains are not served yet.
- **Manual droplet rollout note:** a `BREEZE_VERSION` bump only swaps the `api`/`web` images. To
  light up the portal on an existing droplet you must also: add `BREEZE_PORTAL_IMAGE_REF` (or
  `BREEZE_PORTAL_IMAGE_DIGEST` for the digest-pinned prod compose) and `PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL` to
  `/opt/breeze/.env`, ensure the `portal` service + the `/portal` carve-out are present in the deployed
  `docker-compose.yml`/`Caddyfile.prod`, then `docker compose up -d portal && docker compose
  restart caddy`.
