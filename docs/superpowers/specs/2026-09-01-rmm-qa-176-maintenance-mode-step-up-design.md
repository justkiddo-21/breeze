# RMM-QA-176 Device Maintenance-Mode Step-Up Design

## September 6 continuation

The original decisions below describe the initial implementation. The continuation
integrates main at `686a4f6a75a3d0f90baa587910dc4b39b66e1588` and strengthens
the existing admission contract:

- Device-page dialogs discover account factors after `STEP_UP_REQUIRED`, allowing
  passkey-only technicians to complete the ceremony. Discovery failure is visible;
  deployments accepting the first request without MFA need no discovery.
- Step-up proof errors retain main's `400 mfa_proof_invalid` contract and allow
  authentication middleware to refresh an expired bearer before proof consumption.
- Single and bulk entry hold a SHARE lock on the actor row and compare live,
  token, and grant epochs before consuming a grant. Factor reset and maintenance
  writes therefore serialize on the actor row.
- Bulk device locks follow sorted, deduplicated IDs. Entry, bulk, and exit compare
  the locked device's organization/site with the authorized preflight location;
  a concurrent move rolls back the maintenance operation.
- Active-lease menu labels use the same predicate as the action handler. Entry
  and exit confirmation copy makes no suppression promise.
- The unshipped, idempotent lease migration is resequenced to
  `2026-10-12-000100-device-manual-maintenance-lease.sql`; SQL contents are
  unchanged. Fresh migration, repeat application, export, and RLS checks run
  against a private PostgreSQL stack with an unprivileged application role.

Manual-lease suppression remains RMM-QA-217. Maintenance inline-settings
validation remains the separate finding excluded by this design; neither
implementation review nor CI constitutes candidate verification or QA closure.

**Goal:** Close RMM-QA-176 against current `main`: `POST /devices/:id/maintenance` (`apps/api/src/routes/devices/commands.ts:362-413`) mutates monitoring posture behind `devices:write` + site scope only. The exit-evidence contract (backlog row) is: *require fresh MFA/step-up for maintenance entry and extension, audit actor/reason/window, keep exit safely available, and prove non-assured-session / API-key denial with zero state change.* This design gates entry and extension behind an assured session **and** an operation-bound, single-use step-up grant; persists a manual lease on `devices` so "extension" is a real operation with an auditable window; keeps exit un-gated but truthful; and closes the two parallel, API-key-reachable authoring paths for maintenance suppression (config-policy feature links over HTTP and the MCP `manage_policy_feature_link` tool) that the verifier identified as the *actual* suppression source.

**Method note:** every file:line below was re-read in the worktree before designing. The brief was written against an older `main`; the handler and schema are byte-identical to the brief's characterization (`git log ca6ccb1d8..HEAD -- routes/devices/commands.ts routes/devices/schemas.ts` still lists only `3bf6579ff`, `09ffa6e76`, `4c75a8d45`, none touching the maintenance handler). **Main has moved since the brief and since the first draft of this spec.** The branch was fast-forwarded from `418f7a407` to `fcd5b498a` (three commits: #4493 script-children RLS, #4509 docs, #4504 AI Impact page); the only one that touches anything this design depends on is #4493, which adds `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-01-100000-script-children-rls.sql` and thereby moves the migration ceiling (F13). No file named in §1 or §3 changed otherwise. Claims are labelled *verified* unless marked *inferred*.

## Non-goals and boundaries

- **RMM-QA-217 stays a separate finding.** This PR does NOT make the heartbeat preserve the lease (`routes/agents/heartbeat.ts:750` still writes `status: 'online'`), does NOT fold the manual lease into the suppression consumers (`checkDeviceMaintenanceWindow`, `services/featureConfigResolver.ts:2185`, read by patch/script/reboot paths), does NOT add a lease-expiry sweeper, and does NOT add a countdown to the device UI. The lease columns are designed so 217 can build on them without a second migration (§D6), and the truth gap is stated as a non-claim (§10). §8a records the one brief item this boundary refutes, with evidence.
- No edit to any QA probe under `breeze-rmm-qa/docs/qa/probes/`. `core-device-actions-release-contract.test.ts:83-96` is a *characterization* of the unsafe state (it asserts `not.toContain("requireMfa()")` and the literal `const targetStatus = data.enable ? 'maintenance' : 'online'`); it is expected to flip after this lands and its update is the QA repo's job, not this branch's.
- No production deployment, no customer-device mutation, no rollout claim.
- No change to the legacy `/maintenance/*` window routes (all seven mutations already carry `requireMfa()`, `routes/maintenance.ts`), to `isDeviceInMaintenance` (`services/maintenanceService.ts:42-83`), or to the `maintenance` inline-settings validation gap (a different finding).
- No unrelated refactoring. The only shared-code touches outside the maintenance surface are (a) exporting the offline threshold from one place so exit can compute liveness (§D7) and (b) extracting the web step-up mint into a reusable helper (§D10), both guarded by existing suites.

## 1. Verified facts (current main @ fcd5b498a)

| # | Fact | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Maintenance route chain is `requireScope` + `requirePermission(devices:write)` + `zValidator(maintenanceModeSchema)`; siblings carry `requireMfa()` at `:28`, `:248`, `:421`. Entry and exit share the handler via `data.enable`; `durationHours` is echoed into audit details and never persisted. | `routes/devices/commands.ts:362-413`, `routes/devices/schemas.ts:185-188` |
| F2 | `requireMfa()` is a *session-claim* check: `hasSatisfiedMfa` returns `true` when `ENABLE_2FA` is off, else `auth.token?.mfa === true`. It 403s `ai_agent` principals and returns `{ error: 'MFA required', code: 'MFA_REQUIRED' }`. | `middleware/auth.ts:855-888`; `ENABLE_2FA = envFlag('ENABLE_2FA', true)` at `routes/auth/schemas.ts:10` |
| F3 | An operation-bound, single-use step-up grant primitive already exists: Redis-backed, 300 s TTL, bound to `userId/operation/authEpoch/mfaEpoch/sid/resourceDigest`, `validateStepUpGrant` (non-consuming) and `consumeStepUpGrant` (`getdel`). Operations today: `add_factor`, `register_approver_device`, `agent_rollback`, `enroll_first_factor`. | `services/mfaStepUpGrant.ts:33-132` |
| F4 | Grants are minted by `POST /auth/mfa/step-up` (TOTP / SMS / passkey, per-user rate-limited, audited `auth.mfa.stepup.granted`), which returns `mfaDisabledResponse` (404) when `ENABLE_2FA` is off; `resource` binding is currently hard-wired to `agent_rollback` only (`:1101-1105`, digest at `:1181`). | `routes/auth/mfa.ts:1094-1197`; `routes/auth/schemas.ts:147-179`; `routes/auth/helpers.ts:1309` |
| F5 | The closest precedent for a device action behind a fresh factor is agent rollback: `isInteractiveUserSession` gate → permission → site → `requireMfa()` → digest-bound grant validated before, consumed inside, the write transaction. | `routes/agentRollback.ts:34-60`; `services/agentRollback.ts:371, 419` |
| F6 | `/devices` is mounted under JWT `authMiddleware` only (`index.ts:840`); `X-API-Key` and MCP OAuth bearers never reach it. `isInteractiveUserSession` (`middleware/auth.ts:64`) is the repo's written denial for machine principals. API-key/OAuth-grant auth contexts are built with `token: {}` (`routes/mcpServer.ts:2246`), so on an `ENABLE_2FA=false` deployment `hasSatisfiedMfa` would *pass* for them — machine-principal denial must not depend on the MFA gate. | `index.ts:840`; `routes/devices/core.ts:1173-1180` precedent; `routes/mcpServer.ts:2238-2250` |
| F7 | The web client sends `{ enable[, durationHours] }` only; the detail page and list page decide enter-vs-exit from `device.status === 'maintenance'`; bulk is a client loop of N single-device calls. Neither page collects a reason or a factor. | `apps/web/src/services/deviceActions.ts:537-556`; `components/devices/DeviceDetailPage.tsx:295-303`; `components/devices/DevicesPage.tsx:854-862, 1159-1191`; `components/devices/DeviceActions.tsx:158-175` |
| F8 | The web already knows how to mint a grant against `/auth/mfa/step-up` (TOTP and passkey branches) for `register_approver_device`, and has a factor-input component with strongest-factor tiering (`pickReauthTier`). | `apps/web/src/stores/authenticator.ts:88-118`; `components/settings/StepUpPrompt.tsx:8` |
| F9 | Config-policy feature links gate MFA on `featureType === 'patch'` only, at add (`:107`), update (`:286`), remove (`:438`). `'maintenance'` links (the canonical suppression source) are un-gated. | `routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.ts` |
| F10 | MCP `manage_policy_feature_link` is base Tier 2; only `remove` escalates to Tier 3 (`TIER3_ACTIONS` `:209`, `TIER3_SUPERVISED_ACTIONS` `:396`). `checkGuardrails(toolName, input)` receives the full input (`:1251`), checks `TIER1_ACTIONS` before `TIER3_ACTIONS`, and `resolveApprovalScope` (`:466`) already has *input-aware* overrides exempted from the static-table contract via `TIER3_INPUT_AWARE_ACTIONS` (`:452`, currently only `manage_organizations:update_org`). | `services/aiGuardrails.ts` |
| F11 | Over MCP, every effective-Tier-3 call is denied fail-closed (`MCP_APPROVAL_REQUIRED`) before `executeTool`; effective tier is `Math.max(baseTier, checkGuardrails(...).tier)` (`:1194`). API-key and OAuth-grant principals are built at `:2174-2175`. The AI tool handler receives the `AuthContext` (`safeHandler('manage_policy_feature_link', async (input, auth) => …)`, `services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts:751`), so `auth.principal.kind` is available in-handler (precedent: `services/aiToolsTicketing.ts:66`). | `routes/mcpServer.ts:945-1010, 1194-1203, 2174-2175`; `services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts:751-845` |
| F12 | `devices` is an org-cascade table whose export policy enumerates every column; adding a column without registering it fails `tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts` ("unclassified"). | `services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts:185`; `__tests__/integration/tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts` |
| F13 | Migration ceiling on `fcd5b498a`: `2026-10-01-100000-script-children-rls.sql` (**superseded during execution** — the ceiling at merge-forward time is `2026-10-04-100002-portal-users-contact-composite-fk.sql`) (it shares the `100000` stamp with `2026-10-01-100000-ai-agents-graduation-evidence.sql`; `localeCompare` orders `script-` after `ai-agents-`). Rule 3 of `scripts/check-migration-naming.sh` requires strict sort-after-max (checked in `--staged` mode only), preferred form `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-<slug>.sql`. | `apps/api/migrations/`; `scripts/check-migration-naming.sh:32-50, 101-137` |
| F14 | Liveness threshold is a private constant `DEFAULT_OFFLINE_THRESHOLD_MINUTES = 5` in the offline detector; the detector only flips `online`/`updating` → `offline`, so a device left at `status='maintenance'` is never re-evaluated. | `jobs/offlineDetector.ts:37, 238, 316-317` |
| F15 | Existing tests: `commands.test.ts:61` stubs `requireMfa` as pass-through, and its three maintenance cases (`:852-921`) cover enable / decommissioned / site scope only. `devices.endpoints.test.ts:238-262` gets a 200 on enable with the default `mfa: false` token (`__tests__/helpers.ts:93`) — live proof the route is ungated. `featureLinks.test.ts:46` stubs `hasSatisfiedMfa: () => true`. | as cited |
| F16 | `ENABLE_2FA` is a module constant; the established way to flip it per test is a `vi.mock('./schemas', …)` getter (`routes/auth/login.test.ts:271-280`). | as cited |
| F17 | The audit action label map for device events lists `device.maintenance.enable/disable` only. | `routes/devices/events.ts:346-347` |
| F18 | The AI tier parity mirrors (`apps/web/src/components/ai-risk/tierConfig.ts`, `apps/docs/.../features/ai.mdx`) do not mention `manage_policy_feature_link`, so an input-aware escalation of it does not trip either parity suite. | grep, zero hits |
| F19 | `isDeviceInMaintenance` (`services/maintenanceService.ts:42`) has exactly ONE non-test caller: the device maintenance-status *read* at `routes/maintenance.ts:306`. Suppression consumers (patch/script/reboot/alerts) read `featureConfigResolver.checkDeviceMaintenanceWindow` (`:2185`) / `resolveMaintenanceConfigForDevice` (`:827`) instead — the QA probe `maintenance-window-contract.test.tsx:96-103` pins exactly this split. | grep `isDeviceInMaintenance\b` across `apps/api/src` excluding tests |
| F20 | The `/auth/mfa/step-up` route's operation/resource binding is tested in `routes/auth.test.ts` (`describe('POST /auth/mfa/step-up')` at `:3675`); `routes/auth/mfa.test.ts` does not exist. The operation list's `enroll_first_factor` exclusion is asserted in `routes/auth/schemas.test.ts`. | as cited |

## 2. Decisions

Each decision names the option chosen, why, the cost if wrong, and which verifier concern (C1–C7 from the brief's `verdict.fixDesignConcerns`, in order) it discharges.

### D1 — Entry and extension require an assured session AND a fresh operation-bound step-up grant

**Chosen:** `enable:true` (entry *or* extension) passes `requireMfa()` (session claim, F2) **and** presents a `stepUpGrant` minted by `POST /auth/mfa/step-up` with `operation: 'device_maintenance'`, bound by `resourceDigest` to `{ deviceIds (sorted, deduped), reason, durationHours }`. The grant is validated (non-consuming) after device authorization and consumed (`getdel`) inside the write transaction, exactly as agent rollback does (F5). When `ENABLE_2FA` is off the grant requirement is skipped (the mint route 404s in that mode, F4; every other gate in the system already yields to that deployment-wide opt-out, which logs a boot-time warning).

An **unconditional** `isInteractiveUserSession` gate sits first in the chain (after scope), for entry *and* exit. This is not redundant with `requireMfa()`: machine principals carry `token: {}` (F6), so with `ENABLE_2FA=false` the MFA gate would admit them; the interactive gate is what makes "API-key denial with zero state change" independent of MFA configuration.

**Rejected:** (a) `requireMfa()` alone — satisfies "non-assured session denied" but not "fresh": a session that completed MFA hours ago could enter maintenance silently; the verifier flagged exactly this. (b) A fresh TOTP code in the body — TOTP-only (locks out passkey users), consumed per call, so bulk would need N codes.

**Cost if wrong:** one extra factor prompt per maintenance entry; technicians whose only factor is SMS cannot mint a grant (no authenticated step-up SMS sender exists; the same limitation already applies to approver-device registration) and are told to add TOTP or a passkey. Flagged in §10 as a product follow-up, not hidden.

Discharges C1 (tests set `ENABLE_2FA` explicitly, §5) and is the answer to open decision 1.

### D2 — Bulk entry becomes a server-side operation under ONE single-use grant

**Chosen:** new `POST /devices/bulk/maintenance` (entry only) takes `{ deviceIds[1..500], reason, durationHours, stepUpGrant }` and runs in three phases: (1) **preflight, no writes** — validate the grant (non-consuming) against the digest of the *whole* deduplicated set, then authorize every device (org check, site check, entry-state allowlist §D3) collecting ineligible ones as `failed[]` with codes; (2) **consume the grant once**; (3) **one transaction** that locks and updates every eligible device via the shared entry helper, all-or-nothing. Per-device audit rows are written after commit. Response `{ succeeded: [{ deviceId, action, maintenanceUntil }], failed: [{ deviceId, code, message }] }` in the shape of bulk wake (`commands.ts:46-120`). The web's `maintenance-on` bulk path switches to it.

**Rejected:** (a) a multi-use grant re-presented by N single-device calls — it would need either a grant record that carries a device set (a new field on a shared security primitive) or a digest the single route cannot reproduce, and a partially-used multi-use grant is a wider replay window than a single `getdel`; (b) per-device transactions in a worker pool (bulk wake's shape) — the quorum's point stands that authorization and state change should be decided before any write, and one transaction over ≤500 small row updates is well inside the proxy budget.

**Cost if wrong:** an eligible-set write failure rolls the whole batch back and the grant is already burned; the technician re-steps-up. Devices that fail preflight never touch the transaction and are reported, not retried silently. "Zero state change on denial" holds by construction: every denial (session, MFA, grant, interactive gate) happens before phase 3.

Discharges C5.

### D3 — Exit stays un-gated, becomes truthful, and never lies about liveness

**Chosen:** `enable:false` needs scope, interactive session, permission and site access only (no MFA, no grant). It clears the lease and sets `status` from **fresh evidence**, not from a stored pre-maintenance value: if `status` is currently `'maintenance'`, it becomes `'online'` when `last_seen_at >= now - DEFAULT_OFFLINE_THRESHOLD_MINUTES`, else `'offline'`; any other current status (e.g. `'online'` after a heartbeat overwrite, `'updating'`) is left untouched. Exit on a device with no lease and a non-maintenance status is a 200 no-op with `changed:false` and **no** audit row (an audit must not claim a transition that did not happen).

**Entry-state allowlist (quorum finding):** entry and extension are permitted only when the device's current `status` is `online`, `offline` or `maintenance`. `decommissioned` keeps its existing 400; `quarantined`, `pending` and `updating` are rejected with `409 { error, code: 'MAINTENANCE_STATE_CONFLICT' }` naming the status. Without this, a quarantined device could be laundered to `online`/`offline` through enter-then-exit (`deviceStatusEnum`, `db/schema/devices.ts:7`; the heartbeat's own terminal-status guard at `heartbeat.ts:943` treats `quarantined` as untouchable). Codex proposed "entry from `online|offline`, extension from `maintenance`"; the single allowlist is the reconciled form because entry-vs-extension is decided by the *lease* (D6), not by `status` — a device whose heartbeat has already overwritten `maintenance` → `online` while its lease is active must still be extendable, and a device still labelled `maintenance` with an expired lease is a fresh entry.

**Rejected:** persisting `pre_maintenance_status` and restoring it verbatim — the verifier's C3 scenario (device goes offline during the window, exit resurrects a stale `'online'` until the next heartbeat). No such column is added.

**Cost if wrong:** a technician cannot put a device into maintenance during the few minutes it reports `updating`; they retry after the update. Acceptable and conservative.

Discharges C3 and open decision 2.

### D4 — `reason` and `durationHours` are REQUIRED on entry; the web dialog ships in the same PR

**Chosen:** `maintenanceModeSchema` becomes a discriminated union on `enable`: `{ enable: true, reason: string(3..500, trimmed), durationHours: int(1..168), stepUpGrant?: uuid }` / `{ enable: false }`, both `.strict()`. No server default for reason. The web ships `MaintenanceModeDialog` (reason, duration, factor) in this PR (§D10), so no released client is left sending the old body. The current exit call already sends exactly `{ enable: false }` (F7: `durationHours` is omitted when undefined), so the strict exit shape does not break the shipped exit path.

**Rejected:** optional-with-default for one release — it would ship a "gated" endpoint whose audit rows say `reason: null`, which is the contract's *audit actor/reason/window* clause failing on day one.

**Cost if wrong:** any third-party caller of the old body shape breaks with a 400 naming the missing field. There are none in-repo (F7); the route is JWT-only (F6), so no API-key integration can exist.

Discharges C4 and open decision 3's dependency.

### D5 — Maintenance lease persisted on `devices` via a new forward migration

**Chosen:** `2026-10-05-100000-device-manual-maintenance-lease.sql` (originally `2026-10-01-100001-…`, sorting after F13's then-ceiling; main landed three later migrations during execution, so Task 14 renamed it to sort strictly after the re-verified ceiling `2026-10-04-100002-portal-users-contact-composite-fk.sql`) adds four nullable columns to `devices`: `maintenance_started_at timestamptz`, `maintenance_until timestamptz`, `maintenance_reason varchar(500)`, `maintenance_started_by uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`, plus an idempotent CHECK `devices_maintenance_lease_chk` (all-null, or `until`+`started_at`+`reason` all set — `started_by` may be null after user erasure). All four register in the `devices` row of `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY` under `included` (customer operational data; none of the names match `SUSPICIOUS_NAME_PARTS`). Drizzle schema gains the matching fields. No index (nothing queries `maintenance_until` yet; RMM-QA-217 adds one when it does). **Re-verify the ceiling at commit time** (`scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --staged`); main moves, and if a later stamp has landed the file takes the next free `2026-10-01-1000NN` or a later date.

**Rejected:** audit-only `durationHours` (today) — "extension" cannot be a real, distinguishable, gated operation without a stored `until`; and a separate `device_maintenance_leases` table — a new tenant-scoped table is a full RLS + cascade + export registration for a 1:1 attribute of a device.

**Cost if wrong:** a lease that no consumer reads yet (non-goal; §10). The columns are the exact shape 217's contract asks for (*start/until/reason/actor*), so 217 needs no second migration.

Discharges C2 and open decision 3.

### D6 — Lease semantics: entry, extension, expiry

- **Active** iff `maintenance_until > now()`. The lease — not `status` — is the truth of "manually in maintenance"; `status='maintenance'` is still written on entry for UI continuity, but the handler never *reads* status to decide entry vs extension (the heartbeat overwrites it, F14/217).
- **The outcome of an authorized request is state-independent.** Whether or not a lease is already active, the result of `{ reason, durationHours }` is exactly `until = now + durationHours` with `reason` as the current justification. The grant a technician minted for "device X, N hours, reason R" therefore always produces "X in maintenance until now+N for reason R" — never a compounded window — which closes the quorum's TOCTOU (a grant minted for entry racing another actor's entry) without binding an `enter`/`extend` intent into the digest. Consequence: "extend by N" means "N more hours from now", and the UI copy says so.
- **Entry** (no active lease): `started_at = now`, `started_by = auth.user.id`, `until`, `reason`, `status = 'maintenance'`. Audit `device.maintenance.enable`.
- **Extension** (active lease): `until` and `reason` replaced as above; `started_at` and `started_by` are **immutable** across extensions (the original actor stays on the row; each extension's actor is on its audit event). Audit `device.maintenance.extend` with `previousMaintenanceUntil`, `previousReason`. Extension needs the same grant as entry.
- **Expiry** is strictly by time (`until` comparison); a forgotten lease cannot stay active. Nothing in this PR *acts* on expiry (217); an expired lease is simply "no active lease", so a new request is an entry.
- `durationHours ≤ 168` is enforced by the schema, so `until ≤ now + 168h` needs no arithmetic cap.
- Both branches run in one `db.transaction`: `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the device row (re-checking the allowlist under the lock), grant `consume`, one `UPDATE … RETURNING *`. The audit row is written after commit via `writeRouteAudit` (fire-and-forget, `services/auditEvents.ts:134-142`), with `{ reason, durationHours, maintenanceUntil, previousMaintenanceUntil, previousReason, maintenanceStartedAt, stepUp: 'grant' | 'disabled_2fa' }` in `details`; `writeRouteAudit` stamps `actorId`/`actorEmail`. **Durable actor/reason/window truth is the row itself** (`maintenance_started_by`, `maintenance_reason`, `maintenance_started_at`, `maintenance_until`, committed in the same transaction as the status change); the audit event is the history trail, best-effort like every other device route's.

Discharges C7 in the only way it applies here: the lease is NOT folded into `isDeviceInMaintenance` or any suppression consumer in this PR (non-goal; §8a), so no new system-context read is introduced; the strict-time expiry rule is still the persisted contract that 217 inherits, and 217's read MUST be a system-context read keyed by `deviceId` only, exactly as `isDeviceInMaintenance` does today.

### D7 — Liveness threshold exported once

**Chosen:** new `services/deviceLiveness.ts` exporting `DEFAULT_OFFLINE_THRESHOLD_MINUTES = 5` and `resolveLivenessStatus(lastSeenAt: Date | null, now: Date): 'online' | 'offline'`; `jobs/offlineDetector.ts` imports the constant instead of its private copy (no behavior change; its six suites are the guard). `commands.ts` uses the helper for D3 rather than importing the BullMQ-bearing detector module.

**Cost if wrong:** none observable; the constant's value is unchanged.

### D8 — HTTP feature links: `maintenance` joins `patch` under the session-claim MFA gate; remove stays open

**Chosen:** `featureLinks.ts` introduces `MFA_GATED_FEATURE_TYPES = new Set(['patch', 'maintenance'])` and uses it at the add (`:107`) and update (`:286`) gates. Remove (`:438`) keeps its `patch`-only gate: removing a maintenance link *ends* suppression, the safe direction, mirroring "keep exit safely available". This is deliberately the same *session-claim* strength as patch, not the D1 grant: a policy-level window is authored configuration, not a per-device actuation, and parity with the adjacent gate is the long-term-consistent shape.

**Cost if wrong:** an assured session with no fresh factor can still author a policy window — identical to patch policy today. Recorded in §10.

Answers open decision 4 (in scope) with the smallest consistent gate.

### D9 — AI path: input-aware Tier-3 escalation for maintenance links; machine principals fail closed; agents get approval, not silence

**Chosen (three parts):**
1. `aiGuardrails.ts`: `checkGuardrails` consults a new input-aware hook after the Tier-1 downgrade and before `TIER3_ACTIONS`: `manage_policy_feature_link` with `action ∈ {add, update}` and `input.featureType === 'maintenance'` resolves Tier 3, `approvalScope: 'supervised'` (parity with the `#3552`/`835f7eb3d` policy-prerequisite escalations, which are `supervised`, not `four_eyes`). The two pairs are added to `TIER3_INPUT_AWARE_ACTIONS` and `resolveApprovalScope` gets the matching override, so the static-table contract tests keep their invariant and the pairs get dedicated both-branches tests.
2. Over MCP this is automatically a fail-closed deny for `api_key` and `oauth_grant` principals (F11) with zero writes. For `ai_agent` principals inside the web app it is the normal supervised approval — an approved run proceeds, matching the verifier's C6 preference over a hard deny.
3. `aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts` handler, belt-and-braces and the anti-bypass for `update` (where `featureType` is not a required input): it resolves the existing link's `featureType` unconditionally; if it is `'maintenance'` and the call did not carry `featureType: 'maintenance'` it returns an actionable error ("re-issue with `featureType: 'maintenance'` so the change routes through approval") **before** any service call; and if the principal is `api_key`/`oauth_grant` (`auth.principal.kind`, available in-handler per F11) it returns a denial for maintenance add/update regardless of tier. `remove` is untouched (already Tier 3).

**Cost if wrong:** an agent run that used to auto-execute a maintenance-link edit now waits for approval; a caller that omits `featureType` on update gets one extra round-trip. Both are the intended friction.

Discharges C6 and open decision 4's MCP half.

### D10 — Web: one dialog, server-driven step-up, reusable mint helper

**Chosen:**
- New `components/devices/MaintenanceModeDialog.tsx` (reason textarea 3..500, duration select 1/2/4/8/24/72/168 h, factor input) used by the detail page, the list page's single action, and the bulk `maintenance-on` action. Enter vs exit is decided by `device.maintenanceUntil > now || device.status === 'maintenance'`; exit keeps the existing `ConfirmDialog`.
- **Server-driven step-up:** the dialog submits without a grant; a `403 { code: 'STEP_UP_REQUIRED' }` reveals the factor step, mints a `device_maintenance` grant bound to the same `{ deviceIds, reason, durationHours }`, and resubmits. The web never needs to know `ENABLE_2FA` — a deployment with 2FA off simply succeeds on the first submit, and the server stays the only enforcer. `403 MFA_REQUIRED` maps to "Complete MFA sign-in first" copy (pattern: `components/settings/OrganizationsPage.tsx:575`, `ArchiveOrgModal.tsx:80`).
- Factor tier via `pickReauthTier(passkeyCount, mfaMethod)` (F8) restricted to `passkey`/`totp`; the `password` tier is not a valid step-up method for this operation, so the dialog shows an "add an authenticator app or passkey" state instead of a submit button.
- Mint logic extracted from `stores/authenticator.ts:88-118` into `lib/mfaStepUp.ts` `mintStepUpGrant({ operation, resource, reauth })`; `mintRegisterGrant` delegates to it for its TOTP/passkey branches (its password branch stays local). `stores/authenticator.test.ts` guards the refactor.
- `services/deviceActions.ts`: `toggleMaintenanceMode` is replaced by `enterMaintenanceMode(deviceId, body)`, `exitMaintenanceMode(deviceId)`, `bulkEnterMaintenanceMode(body)`; all three throw an `ActionError`-compatible error carrying `code` so the dialog can branch. Mutation feedback follows the surrounding pages' existing pattern (the `no-silent-mutations` suite decides whether they need `runAction` or an allowlist row — `deviceActions.ts` already has one row for the typed Wake service, `lib/runActionAllowlist.ts:4`; no new silent path is introduced).
- `packages/shared` `Device` (`src/types/index.ts:142`) gains `maintenanceUntil?: string | null`, `maintenanceStartedAt?`, `maintenanceReason?`, `maintenanceStartedBy?` (the API returns the updated row already). Locale keys are added to all eight locales (`de-DE, en, es-419, fr-CA, fr-FR, it-IT, pt-BR, tr-TR`; `localeParity.test.ts`).

**Cost if wrong:** one extra request on the happy path when 2FA is on. Accepted for the guarantee that the client can never decide it does not need a factor.

### D11 — Step-up mint route generalizes resource binding instead of adding a second `if`

`routes/auth/schemas.ts`: `STEP_UP_OPERATIONS` gains `'device_maintenance'` (still `Exclude<…, 'enroll_first_factor'>`-typed); `resource` becomes `z.union([rollbackStepUpResource, maintenanceStepUpResource]).optional()` where `maintenanceStepUpResource = { deviceIds: uuid[1..500], reason: string(3..500, trimmed), durationHours: int(1..168) }`. `routes/auth/mfa.ts:1101-1105` replaces the two `agent_rollback` ifs with a `RESOURCE_BOUND_OPERATIONS` map `{ agent_rollback: rollbackStepUpResource, device_maintenance: maintenanceStepUpResource }`: an operation in the map must carry a resource that parses under *its* schema; an operation outside it must carry none. Digest: `maintenanceResourceDigest` lives beside `rollbackResourceDigest` in `services/mfaStepUpGrant.ts:65`, canonicalizes (sort + dedupe `deviceIds`, trim `reason`) and is the single function both the mint route and the maintenance routes call, so drift between them is impossible by construction.

### D12 — Audit vocabulary

New action `device.maintenance.extend` (label "Maintenance mode extended" in `routes/devices/events.ts:346`). `enable`/`disable` keep their names; `disable` details gain `{ previousMaintenanceUntil, previousReason, resolvedStatus, endedEarly }`. Bulk entry writes one audit row per device (same shape as single) — no aggregate row, so the audit trail is per-resource like bulk wake.

## 3. Contracts per file

### API

| File | Contract |
|---|---|
| `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-05-100000-device-manual-maintenance-lease.sql` | `ALTER TABLE devices ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` ×4 as in D5; CHECK added inside a `pg_constraint` existence guard; no inner `BEGIN/COMMIT`; re-apply is a no-op. Header comment cites RMM-QA-176 and the 217 hand-off. |
| `apps/api/src/db/schema/devices.ts` | Four fields after `isEphemeral` (`:85`): `maintenanceStartedAt`, `maintenanceUntil` (`timestamp(..., { withTimezone: true })`), `maintenanceReason` (`varchar(500)`), `maintenanceStartedBy` (`uuid … .references(() => users.id, { onDelete: 'set null' })`; `users` is already imported at `:3`). `pnpm db:check-drift` clean. |
| `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts:185` | The four column names appended to `devices.included`. |
| `apps/api/src/services/deviceLiveness.ts` (new) | `DEFAULT_OFFLINE_THRESHOLD_MINUTES`, `resolveLivenessStatus`. Pure; no DB. |
| `apps/api/src/jobs/offlineDetector.ts:37` | Imports the constant from `deviceLiveness.ts`; local `const` deleted. No other change. |
| `apps/api/src/services/mfaStepUpGrant.ts` | `StepUpOperation` gains `'device_maintenance'`; `maintenanceResourceDigest(input: { deviceIds: string[]; reason: string; durationHours: number }): \`sha256:${string}\`` with canonicalization documented in-code. `MAINTENANCE_MAX_DURATION_HOURS = 168`, `MAINTENANCE_MAX_BULK_DEVICES = 500` exported from here (single owner of the numbers the schema, the digest and the bulk route share). |
| `apps/api/src/routes/auth/schemas.ts` | D11: operations list + `maintenanceStepUpResource` + `resource` union. |
| `apps/api/src/routes/auth/mfa.ts:1094-1197` | D11: `RESOURCE_BOUND_OPERATIONS`; digest dispatch by operation; audit `details.operation` unchanged. |
| `apps/api/src/services/deviceMaintenanceLease.ts` (new) | `MAINTENANCE_ENTRY_ALLOWED_STATUSES = ['online','offline','maintenance'] as const`; `applyMaintenanceEntry(tx, { deviceId, reason, durationHours, actorUserId, now })` → `{ action: 'enable' \| 'extend', previousUntil, previousReason, until, startedAt, device }` or throws typed `MaintenanceLeaseError` with `code: 'not_found' \| 'decommissioned' \| 'state_conflict'` (+ `status`); `clearMaintenanceLease(tx, { deviceId, now })` → `{ changed, previousUntil, previousReason, resolvedStatus, device }`. Both take the caller's `tx`, lock with `FOR UPDATE`, re-check state under the lock, and issue exactly one `UPDATE`. No Redis, no auth — the route owns grant handling. |
| `apps/api/src/routes/devices/schemas.ts:185-188` | D4 discriminated union `maintenanceModeSchema`; new `bulkMaintenanceSchema` `{ deviceIds: uuid[1..MAINTENANCE_MAX_BULK_DEVICES], reason, durationHours, stepUpGrant?: uuid }.strict()`; shared `maintenanceReasonSchema`, `maintenanceDurationSchema`. |
| `apps/api/src/routes/devices/commands.ts:362-413` | Chain: `requireScope('organization','partner','system')` → interactive-session gate (`isInteractiveUserSession`, 403 `Interactive user session required`, unconditional) → `requirePermission(devices:write)` → `zValidator` → `requireMaintenanceEntryMfa` (runs `requireMfa()` only when `data.enable === true`; exit bypasses) → handler. Handler: device lookup (404) → site (403) → decommissioned (400) → entry-state allowlist (409 `MAINTENANCE_STATE_CONFLICT`, entry only) → **entry**: `ENABLE_2FA` ? require + validate grant (403 `{ error: 'Step-up required', code: 'STEP_UP_REQUIRED' }` for missing / stale / mismatched, indistinguishably) : skip → `db.transaction`: consume grant (403 `STEP_UP_REQUIRED` on race) → `applyMaintenanceEntry` (a `state_conflict` raised under the lock maps to the same 409) → commit → audit → `200 { success: true, action, maintenance: { until, startedAt, reason }, device }`. **Exit**: `db.transaction` → `clearMaintenanceLease` → audit only if `changed` → `200 { success: true, changed, device }`. Every 4xx before the transaction has `db.update`/`db.transaction` un-called (the zero-state-change proof). |
| `apps/api/src/routes/devices/commands.ts` (new route, before `/:id/…`) | `POST /bulk/maintenance`: same middleware chain with `requireMfa()` unconditional (entry-only route) → phase 1 preflight: grant validate against the full-set digest, then per device org check / site / decommissioned / allowlist, collecting `failed[]` with codes `TARGET_NOT_FOUND \| SITE_ACCESS_DENIED \| DECOMMISSIONED \| STATE_CONFLICT` (no writes yet; an empty eligible set returns 200 with all failures and the grant untouched) → phase 2 consume once (403 `STEP_UP_REQUIRED`, zero writes) → phase 3 one `db.transaction` over the eligible set via `applyMaintenanceEntry` (a `state_conflict` surfacing under the lock aborts the transaction and is reported as 409 for the batch) → per-device audit after commit → `200 { succeeded: [{ deviceId, action, maintenanceUntil }], failed: [...] }`. Mount order: `/bulk/maintenance` is registered before `/:id/maintenance` in the same router (precedent `/bulk/commands` at `:25`); `commandsRoutes` is the last router mounted in `routes/devices/index.ts:103`, and no earlier router registers a `POST /bulk/*` or `POST /:id/maintenance` (verified by grep of the mount list at `:44-103`). |
| `apps/api/src/routes/devices/events.ts:346` | `'device.maintenance.extend': 'Maintenance mode extended'`. |
| `apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.ts:107, 286` | `MFA_GATED_FEATURE_TYPES.has(featureType) && !hasSatisfiedMfa(auth)` → 403 `{ error: 'MFA required' }` (existing shape). `:438` unchanged. |
| `apps/api/src/services/aiGuardrails.ts` | `TIER3_INPUT_AWARE_ACTIONS` (`:452`) += `manage_policy_feature_link:add`, `:update`; exported `isInputAwareTier3(toolName, action, input): boolean` (true iff tool is `manage_policy_feature_link`, action ∈ {add, update}, `input.featureType === 'maintenance'`); `checkGuardrails` (`:1251`) returns `{ tier: 3, allowed: true, requiresApproval: true, approvalScope: resolveApprovalScope(...), description }` when it is true, positioned after the `TIER1_ACTIONS` check and before `TIER3_ACTIONS`; `resolveApprovalScope` (`:466`) override returns `'supervised'` for those pairs (guarded by the same predicate so a non-maintenance `add` never reaches the override). `buildApprovalDescription` names the feature type. |
| `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts:751-845` | D9 part 3. The existing-link lookup for `update` (`:816-823`) moves above the `inlineSettings` branch and runs unconditionally. Error strings are constants exported for the tests. |

### Web

| File | Contract |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/src/lib/mfaStepUp.ts` (new) | `mintStepUpGrant({ operation, resource?, reauth: { method: 'totp', code } \| { method: 'passkey' } }): Promise<string>`; throws `StepUpMintError` with `code: 'invalid_factor' \| 'unavailable'` on 401/5xx; passes `skipUnauthorizedRetry: true` like the store does today. |
| `apps/web/src/stores/authenticator.ts:88-118` | `mintRegisterGrant` delegates its TOTP/passkey branches to `mintStepUpGrant({ operation: 'register_approver_device', … })`; the password branch and the return-field mapping are unchanged. |
| `apps/web/src/services/deviceActions.ts:537-556` | `toggleMaintenanceMode` removed; `enterMaintenanceMode`, `exitMaintenanceMode`, `bulkEnterMaintenanceMode` as in D10; error objects expose `status` and `code`. |
| `apps/web/src/components/devices/MaintenanceModeDialog.tsx` (new) | Props `{ open, devices: Array<{ id; hostname }>, onClose, onCompleted(result) }`; states `form → stepUp → submitting`; `data-testid`s: `maintenance-reason`, `maintenance-duration`, `maintenance-stepup-code`, `maintenance-submit`; i18n namespace `devices`. |
| `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceActions.tsx:158-175` | `maintenance` when not in maintenance opens the dialog (no `ConfirmDialog`); when in maintenance keeps the exit `ConfirmDialog`. In-maintenance predicate as in D10. |
| `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceDetailPage.tsx:295-303`, `DevicesPage.tsx:854-862, 1159-1191` | Wire the dialog; `maintenance-on` bulk calls `bulkEnterMaintenanceMode` and reuses the existing `bulkMaintenance*` toast keys; `maintenance-off` loop calls `exitMaintenanceMode`. |
| `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts:142` | Four optional lease fields on `Device`. |
| `apps/web/src/locales/*/devices.json` (8 locales) | Keys for the dialog, `STEP_UP_REQUIRED`/`MFA_REQUIRED` copy, and the "add an authenticator" state. |

### Docs

`apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/maintenance-windows.mdx` gets a short "Manual maintenance mode" note (reason + duration required, step-up prompt, extension semantics, exit does not need MFA). Not a gate; listed in the ship sequence.

## 4. Data flow (entry, single device, 2FA on)

1. Dialog submits `{ enable: true, reason, durationHours }` → `403 STEP_UP_REQUIRED`.
2. Dialog mints: `POST /auth/mfa/step-up { method, code|credential, operation: 'device_maintenance', resource: { deviceIds: [id], reason, durationHours } }` → `{ stepUpGrantId }` (grant bound to user/sid/epochs/digest, 300 s, single use).
3. Dialog resubmits with `stepUpGrant` → middleware (scope, interactive, permission, body, `requireMfa`) → handler authorizes the device → `validateStepUpGrant` (non-consuming) → transaction: `consumeStepUpGrant` → `applyMaintenanceEntry` → commit → audit → 200.
4. A replay of step 3 fails at `validate` (grant gone) with 403 and zero writes.

## 5. RED test list

Every control is written before its implementation, run to a recorded failure on current `main` (the failing assertion text goes into the commit message), and — for controls that could pass vacuously — mutated once after GREEN to prove it discriminates (mutation named per row; the mutation is reverted, not committed).

| # | File | Control | Expected RED on main | Discrimination proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | `routes/devices/commands.test.ts` | Precondition assertion: the suite imports `ENABLE_2FA` (via the `vi.mock('../../routes/auth/schemas')` getter pattern, F16) and asserts it is `true` at the top of the maintenance `describe`; `requireMfa`/`hasSatisfiedMfa` are the real implementations (partial mock via `importOriginal`). | Fails on main because the file's wholesale auth mock has no `hasSatisfiedMfa`; establishes that later reds are not `ENABLE_2FA=false` artefacts (C1). | Flip the getter to `false` → T2 goes green (vacuous) — recorded once, reverted. |
| T2 | same | `{ enable: true, reason, durationHours }` with token `mfa: false` → `403`, `body.code === 'MFA_REQUIRED'`, `db.transaction`/`db.update` not called, `writeRouteAudit` not called. | 200 on main (route ungated). | Remove `requireMaintenanceEntryMfa` from the chain → red. |
| T3 | same | assured token, no `stepUpGrant` → `403 STEP_UP_REQUIRED`, zero writes; stale/mismatched grant (`validateStepUpGrant` mocked `false`) → same, indistinguishable body. | 200 on main. | Skip the validate call → red. |
| T4 | same | assured token + valid grant, device with no lease → `consumeStepUpGrant` called with binding `{ userId, operation: 'device_maintenance', authEpoch, mfaEpoch, sid, resourceDigest: maintenanceResourceDigest({ deviceIds:[id], reason, durationHours }) }`; response `action: 'enable'`; audit `device.maintenance.enable` with `details.reason`, `durationHours`, `maintenanceUntil`, `stepUp: 'grant'`. | Fails (no such fields). | Change digest input order without canonicalization → red (digest mismatch). |
| T5 | same | device with an active lease (`maintenance_until` = now+1h, `started_by` = user-A) → `action: 'extend'`, new `until` = now + `durationHours` (NOT old + duration), `reason` replaced, `started_at`/`started_by` unchanged (user-A, not the caller), audit `device.maintenance.extend` with `previousMaintenanceUntil`/`previousReason`. An expired lease (`until` = now−1h) → `action: 'enable'` and `started_by` = caller. Still requires the grant (a `mfa:false` token gets 403). Status `quarantined` / `pending` / `updating` → 409 `MAINTENANCE_STATE_CONFLICT`, zero writes. | Fails. | Compute `old + duration` → first case red; overwrite `started_by` → immutability red; drop the allowlist → 409 cases red. |
| T6 | same | consume returns `false` (race) → `403 STEP_UP_REQUIRED`, `UPDATE` not issued. | Fails. | Consume after the update → red. |
| T7 | same | `{ enable: false }` with `mfa: false` token → 200, no grant consulted; `status` was `'maintenance'`, `last_seen_at` 10 min ago → `resolvedStatus: 'offline'`; 1 min ago → `'online'`; status `'updating'` → untouched; audit `device.maintenance.disable` with `previousMaintenanceUntil`, `endedEarly`. Exit on a device with no lease and `status: 'online'` → `200 { changed: false }` and **no** audit call. | Main: exit forces `'online'` and always audits → red. | Hard-code `'online'` → offline case red. |
| T8 | same | Missing `reason` / `reason` of 2 chars / `durationHours: 0` / `169` / extra field → 400 with the field named; `{ enable: false, durationHours: 2 }` → 400 (`strict`). | Main accepts → red. | Loosen `.strict()` → last case red. |
| T9 | same | `auth.principal.kind === 'api_key'` with `token: {}` (mocked auth context, F6 shape) on entry and on exit, **with the `ENABLE_2FA` getter flipped to `false` for this case** → `403 Interactive user session required`, zero writes. | Main 200 → red. | Remove gate → red (and would stay green with 2FA on, which is why the case runs with it off). |
| T10 | same | `POST /devices/bulk/maintenance` with 5 device ids (one duplicated → 4 unique): grant digest over the sorted unique set; one device 404s, one site-denied, one quarantined, one succeeds → `{ succeeded: [1], failed: [3 with codes] }`; `consumeStepUpGrant` called exactly once and only after preflight; `db.transaction` called exactly once; consume failure → 403 with `db.transaction` never called; all-ineligible set → 200 with `consume` never called. | Route absent → red. | Consume before preflight → ordering red; one transaction per device → "exactly once" red. |
| T11 | `__tests__/devices.endpoints.test.ts:238-262` | Replace "should enable maintenance mode" (mfa:false → 200) with: non-assured session → 403 `MFA_REQUIRED`, `db.update` never called; assured session (`mfa: true`) + grant (module mocked) → 200; `X-API-Key`-only request (no bearer) → 401 from `authMiddleware`, `db.update` never called. | First and third fail on main (200 / not written). | For the third: mount `deviceRoutes` behind a stub that accepts the header → red. |
| T12 | `routes/auth.test.ts` (`describe('POST /auth/mfa/step-up')`, `:3675`) + `routes/auth/schemas.test.ts` | `operation: 'device_maintenance'` without `resource` → 400; with a rollback-shaped resource → 400; with a maintenance resource → grant minted with `resourceDigest === maintenanceResourceDigest(resource)`; `operation: 'add_factor'` with a resource → 400 (unchanged behavior, now via the map); `enroll_first_factor` still rejected (schemas test). | Operation unknown → red. | Remove the map's shape check → second case red. |
| T13 | `services/mfaStepUpGrant.test.ts` | `maintenanceResourceDigest` is order- and duplicate-insensitive on `deviceIds`, trims `reason`, and differs when `durationHours` differs. | Function absent → red. | Skip the sort → red. |
| T14 | `services/deviceMaintenanceLease.test.ts` | Entry / extend (re-lease from now, immutable `started_*`) / expired-lease-is-entry / exit / no-op branches against a mocked `tx` (one `UPDATE` each; `FOR UPDATE` select first); `decommissioned` and each non-allowlisted status → typed error with `code`, no update. | Module absent → red. | Two updates → "exactly one" red; allow `quarantined` → red. |
| T15 | `routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.test.ts` | `hasSatisfiedMfa` mocked `false`: add `featureType: 'maintenance'` → 403, `addFeatureLinkMock` not called; update of an existing maintenance link → 403, `updateFeatureLinkMock` not called; remove of a maintenance link → 200 (still available); add `featureType: 'monitoring'` → not gated (regression guard). | Main: add/update 200 → red. | Gate remove too → third case red. |
| T16 | `services/aiGuardrails.test.ts` + `aiGuardrails.approvalScope.contract.test.ts` | `checkGuardrails('manage_policy_feature_link', { action: 'add', featureType: 'maintenance' })` → tier 3, `approvalScope: 'supervised'`; same with `featureType: 'patch'` → tier 2 (both-branches, as the contract test requires for input-aware pairs); `update` + `featureType: 'maintenance'` → tier 3; the two pairs are in `TIER3_INPUT_AWARE_ACTIONS`; the existing invariants (`scope tables reference only real tier-3 surfaces`, enumeration) stay green. | Tier 2 on main → red. | Escalate regardless of `featureType` → patch branch red. |
| T17 | `services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.test.ts` | Principal `api_key` → add maintenance link → error, `addFeatureLink` not called; `oauth_grant` update of a maintenance link → error, `updateFeatureLink` not called; `user_session` update of a maintenance link *without* `featureType` → the actionable error, no service call; same call *with* `featureType: 'maintenance'` → proceeds; `ai_agent` add with `featureType: 'maintenance'` → proceeds (approval is upstream, handler must not hard-deny). | Main writes → red. | Remove the principal check → first case red. |
| T18 | `routes/mcpServer.approvalGate.test.ts` / `mcpServer.effectiveTier.test.ts` (existing MCP gate suites) | `tools/call manage_policy_feature_link { action: 'add', featureType: 'maintenance' }` under an `api_key` auth → `MCP_APPROVAL_REQUIRED`, handler not invoked; `{ action: 'add', featureType: 'monitoring' }` → executes. | First case executes on main → red. | — (the gate is existing code; the input-aware tier is what changes; T16's mutation covers it). |
| T19 | `__tests__/integration/deviceMaintenanceLease.integration.test.ts` (new, real Postgres) | Migration applies twice cleanly; the CHECK rejects `until` without `reason`; `ON DELETE SET NULL` on `maintenance_started_by`; `tenant-export-policy` and `tenantExportErasureRoundtrip` suites pass with the four columns; `rls-coverage` unchanged (no new table). | Columns absent → red. | Remove one column from the registry → export-policy red ("unclassified"). |
| T20 | `jobs/offlineDetector*.test.ts` (six existing suites) | Green before and after D7 (the constant's value is pinned by these suites). | n/a (guard) | Change the exported constant to 6 → existing threshold assertions red. |
| T21 | `apps/web/src/components/devices/MaintenanceModeDialog.test.tsx` (new) | Submit with 2-char reason disabled; first submit → `403 STEP_UP_REQUIRED` reveals the code field; mint called with `operation: 'device_maintenance'` and the same resource; resubmit carries the grant; `403 MFA_REQUIRED` shows the MFA copy; password-only tier shows the "add authenticator" state and no submit; bulk variant calls `bulkEnterMaintenanceMode` once with all ids. | Component absent → red. | Resubmit without the grant → red. |
| T22 | `apps/web/src/stores/authenticator.test.ts` (existing) + `lib/mfaStepUp.test.ts` (new) | Store suite stays green through the delegate refactor; helper suite: TOTP body shape, passkey ceremony sequence, 401 → `invalid_factor`. | Helper absent → red. | Drop `skipUnauthorizedRetry` → assertion red. |
| T23 | `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts`, `lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts` (existing) | Green after locale keys and mutation-feedback wiring. | n/a (guards) | — |

## 6. Verification battery

Local, before push (unit suites via `pnpm --filter @breeze/api test -- <file>` and `pnpm --filter @breeze/web test -- <file>`):

- API focused: `routes/devices/commands.test.ts`, `__tests__/devices.endpoints.test.ts`, `routes/auth.test.ts`, `routes/auth/schemas.test.ts`, `services/mfaStepUpGrant.test.ts`, `services/deviceMaintenanceLease.test.ts`, `services/deviceLiveness.test.ts`, all six `jobs/offlineDetector*.test.ts`, `routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.test.ts`, all `services/aiGuardrails*.test.ts` (including both parity suites, which need the real registry), `services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.test.ts`, `routes/mcpServer.approvalGate.test.ts`, `routes/mcpServer.effectiveTier.test.ts`, `routes/devices/events.test.ts`, `db/autoMigrate.test.ts`.
- Typecheck `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/shared` under the repo's big-heap Node settings.
- Real Postgres (fresh disposable stack, torn down after): `pnpm db:check-drift`; fresh-DB migrate then re-migrate (idempotency); `tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts`, `tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts`, `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts`, `tenantCascade.integration.test.ts`, the new `deviceMaintenanceLease.integration.test.ts`; then `psql -U breeze_app`: enter maintenance on a fixture device and confirm the row is readable only under the owning org's context.
- Migration gates: `bash scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --staged` on the staged commit (re-verifies the ceiling against whatever main holds at that moment); `autoMigrate.test.ts`.
- Web: dialog, `DeviceActions`, `DevicesPage`, `DeviceDetailPage`, `authenticator` store, `mfaStepUp`, `localeParity`, `no-silent-mutations`; lint on touched files.
- Manual smoke against the dev stack with `ENABLE_2FA=true`: enter (TOTP), extend, exit while offline (status resolves `offline`), bulk of 3 with one decommissioned, replay of a consumed grant (403), API key `POST /devices/:id/maintenance` (401), MCP `manage_policy_feature_link add maintenance` (`MCP_APPROVAL_REQUIRED`). Repeat enter/exit with `ENABLE_2FA=false` (no prompt, audit `stepUp: 'disabled_2fa'`, API key still 403 at the interactive gate).
- QA repo characterization: run `core-device-actions-release-contract.test.ts` and `maintenance-window-contract.test.tsx` against the branch and record which assertions flip (expected: `not.toContain("requireMfa()")`, the `targetStatus` literal, `durationHours: data.durationHours ?? null`, and the feature-link `'patch' &&` shape at probe `:126-129`). Recorded as evidence, not edited.
- Post-push: confirm workflow runs attached to the head (dispatch `gh workflow run CI --ref <branch>` if silent); exact-head CI Success including the `integration-test` shards; one independent review round.

## 7. Ship sequence

1. Docs commit: this spec.
2. RED commits per §5 (test file, recorded failure text in the message), then GREEN commits per area in this order: liveness constant (D7) → grant/digest + step-up route (D11) → migration + schema + registry (D5) → lease service (D6) → routes (D1–D4, D12) → feature links (D8) → guardrails + AI tool (D9) → shared types + web (D10) → docs note.
3. Battery (§6), push, CI, review round, PR titled `fix(api,web): step-up gate and persisted lease for device maintenance mode (RMM-QA-176)`; body records the RED evidence and the §10 non-claims; `Refs` the QA finding id (no GitHub issue exists for it).

## 8. Open decisions, resolved

| Brief's open decision | Resolution | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| Session-claim `requireMfa()` vs operation-bound grant | Both (D1), plus an unconditional interactive-session gate. | One prompt per entry; SMS-only users blocked until they add TOTP/passkey. |
| Gate exit or not | Not gated; truthful liveness-derived status (D3). | An `'updating'` device resurfaces as `online`/`offline` until its next beat. |
| Persist window vs audit-only | Persist on `devices` (D5, D6); no `pre_maintenance_status`; extension = re-lease from now. | Lease is inert to consumers until 217; "extend by N" is "N from now", not "+N". |

### 8a. Brief items refuted with evidence

- **"Include manual maintenance (`until > now`) in `maintenanceService.isDeviceInMaintenance` and expire by time" / `maintenanceService.test.ts` control.** Not adopted in this PR. `isDeviceInMaintenance` has a single non-test caller, the status *read* at `routes/maintenance.ts:306` (F19); every suppression consumer reads `featureConfigResolver.checkDeviceMaintenanceWindow` / `resolveMaintenanceConfigForDevice` instead, which the QA probe `maintenance-window-contract.test.tsx:96-103` pins. Folding the lease into `isDeviceInMaintenance` would therefore change what the status endpoint *reports* without changing what any alert, patch, script or reboot path *does* — a truth claim the PR could not back. The fold-in belongs with RMM-QA-217's "heartbeat preserves the lease / suppression consumers honor it" work, where it can be tested end-to-end against a real consumer; the lease columns and the strict-time expiry rule (D6) are the contract 217 inherits, and C7's tenancy constraint (system-context read keyed by `deviceId` only) is recorded in D6 for it.
- **"Restore `pre_maintenance_status` on exit."** Rejected per C3 (D3); no such column.

## 9. Advisor quorum

Per CLAUDE.md a Codex read-only opinion (`codex exec -s read-only -m gpt-5.6-sol`, transcript at `scratchpad/s1/RMM-QA-176.codex-quorum.txt`, session `01a0603c-f896-7812-b5a6-c67df16a3a43`) was requested on the four consequential choices before this spec was finalized; the transcript was re-read while revising this spec and the summary below matches its final answer verbatim in substance. Verdicts and how each was resolved:

| Point | Codex | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Grant + session claim (D1) | "grant+claim is appropriate"; wants an **unconditional** `isInteractiveUserSession` gate so API-key denial never depends on MFA configuration (API-key contexts carry `token: {}`, `mcpServer.ts:2246`). | Agreed and in the chain (first gate after scope; T9 runs with 2FA off to prove independence). |
| Digest TOCTOU: a grant minted for entry becomes an extension after a concurrent entry; suggests binding `enter`/`extend` intent or the observed `until`. | Real, but intent binding does not compose with bulk (mixed sets). | Resolved by making the outcome state-independent (D6: `until = now + durationHours` regardless of prior lease). The grant then means exactly one thing whatever the state; no intent field. |
| Server-side bulk (D2) | AGREE; wants authorization decided before any write and one transaction. | Adopted: preflight → consume → single transaction (D2). |
| Exit liveness (D3) | DISAGREE without an entry-state allowlist — enter-then-exit would launder `quarantined`; proposes entry from `online|offline`, extension from `maintenance`. | Adopted as a single allowlist `online/offline/maintenance` with 409 otherwise (D3 explains why one list, not two). |
| Extension (D4/D6) | DISAGREE on compounding an expired lease; wants lock + recheck, immutable `started_at/by`, per-extension audit; notes `writeRouteAudit` is fire-and-forget. | Lock + recheck and immutable `started_*` adopted; compounding removed entirely (re-lease from now); the row is named as the durable actor/reason/window record, the audit event as best-effort history (D6, §10). |

No unresolved disagreement remains; the two places where this spec departs from Codex's *suggested mechanism* (no intent binding; no `max(now, until) + duration`) are both because a state-independent outcome makes the mechanism unnecessary, which Codex's own TOCTOU concern was the argument for.

## 10. Non-claims

- **Suppression truth is not changed by this PR.** After entry, the device's alerts/patching/scripts are governed exactly as before: `checkDeviceMaintenanceWindow` and `isDeviceInMaintenance` do not read the lease, the heartbeat still overwrites `status` to `'online'`, and no expiry sweeper exists. The gated operation is the *authoring* of a persisted, audited window; making that window act is RMM-QA-217 (§8a).
- **`ENABLE_2FA=false` deployments get no factor prompt** — consistent with every `requireMfa()` gate in the system, and audited as `stepUp: 'disabled_2fa'`. Machine principals are still denied there by the interactive gate (D1).
- **SMS-only accounts cannot enter maintenance while 2FA is on** until they add TOTP or a passkey (no authenticated step-up SMS sender exists). Product follow-up, surfaced in the dialog copy.
- **Feature-link MFA is session-claim strength**, same as patch; not a fresh factor (D8).
- **The bulk grant is burned once phase 2 runs** (D2); a phase-3 rollback costs a re-prompt; preflight-ineligible devices are reported, never silently retried.
- **Extension history is best-effort.** The row carries the *current* window and the *original* actor; the sequence of extensions and each extension's actor live only in audit events written fire-and-forget after commit, like every other device-route audit.
- **Status `updating`/`pending` devices cannot enter maintenance** until they settle (D3 allowlist); the dialog surfaces the 409 verbatim.
- **Grant consume and the Postgres write are not atomic** (Redis vs Postgres); a write failure after consume costs one re-prompt, never an ungated write.
- **Client-side enter/exit detection** still relies on `status` or `maintenanceUntil` from the last fetch; a stale page can send an "enter" that the server treats as an extension (still gated, still audited as `extend`).
- **The migration filename is provisional until staged** (D5): it sorts after today's ceiling, and the naming gate re-checks it against whatever main holds at commit time.
- **No claim** that the QA probes pass or fail after this change; they are characterizations owned by the QA repo and are re-run for evidence only.
