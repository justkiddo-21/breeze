# AI Agents Phase 2 — Wave P2-5: Feedback + Graduation Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** An agent earns narrower human supervision by evidence. Every terminal outcome an agent produces — a released action intent, an act-mode manifest execution, a fix-watch verdict, a 👍/👎 on an alert verdict — writes exactly ONE immutable row into a new `ai_agent_op_evidence` ledger keyed by `(source_kind, source_id, metric)`, so BullMQ redelivery can never double-count. A `graduationService` reads that ledger over a 30-day window and moves an `(org, agent, op_key)` tuple through `tracking → eligible → promoted → demoted → tracking`. Promotion is never automatic: it is a Tier-3 **four-eyes** action intent (`manage_ai_agents:authorize_supervised_key`, human-only — a device-bound agent can never propose it) whose executor appends the colon key to the **org** row's `ai_agents.actAssets.supervisedActionKeys` under a per-key advisory lock. Demotion IS automatic and always on: the first ATTEMPTED failure or fix-watch recurrence on a granted key removes it in the same transaction as the negative evidence and notifies the agent's recipients at high priority. A read-only Graduation panel and an "Approve and always allow" affordance on `/approvals` make the whole ledger visible with the policy-decide flag still off.

**Architecture:** One Shape-1 org-scoped ledger (`ai_agent_op_evidence`) plus one Shape-1 state table (`ai_agent_graduation`); no daily counter buckets (they cannot be incremented exactly-once, and a timestamped ledger answers "since `demoted_at`" unambiguously where a `date` bucket cannot). Evidence writers are folded into transactions that already exist: the release worker's terminal CAS (one outer `withSystemDbAccessContext`, which every nested DB context joins — `db/index.ts:526-528`), `finishRun`'s post-CAS section, the fix-watch phase-2 verdict CAS, and the verdict-feedback update. Fix watches become **intent-anchored** as well as run-anchored (`intent_id` + partial UNIQUE, `source_kind`, `op_keys[]`), so N independently-released intents from one run each get their own verification episode instead of sharing one run-unique watch. The BLOCKER fix that makes any of this mean something: partner `supervisedActionKeys` become a **ceiling**, not an inherited grant — with no org row the effective key set is `[]`, so promotion (an org-row append) is the only way a key goes live, and demotion (an org-row removal) actually revokes.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Hono, Drizzle, BullMQ, Postgres 15+ (partial unique indexes, `pg_advisory_xact_lock`), Claude Agent SDK MCP tools, Zod, Vitest, React + Astro + react-i18next (8 locales).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-08-28-ai-agents-phase2-intelligence-layer-design.md` §4.5 (lines 141-162), §5 P2-5 rows (lines 187-189, 192), §6 rows (lines 202, 205-206, 208). **This plan amends the spec (Task 0)** per the advisor quorum (Fable + Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` xhigh read-only, 2026-09-01; contract `p2-5-contract.md` C1–C16, all eight ranked Codex amendments adopted): the spec's `ai_agent_op_stats_daily` is **dropped** and replaced by the exactly-once `ai_agent_op_evidence` ledger (C1); `ai_agent_graduation` gains a fourth state `tracking` (C2); partner supervised keys become a ceiling rather than inherited authority (C3, release-blocking); "success" is decomposed into `executed` / `verified` / `failed` / `recurred` with `failed` counting ATTEMPTED failures only (C4); fix watches become intent-anchored (C5, closes #4206); sweep act auto-execution is OUT of P2-5 and moves to roadmap **#4442** (C13).

## Global Constraints

- Tests: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <path>`; shared: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run <path>`; web: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run <path>` + `src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts` + `src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts` + `src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts`. Add `--pool=threads --maxWorkers=2` when a dev stack is running; **a 0-test run is a stall, not green** — always check the reported file count. Never write `pnpm --filter <pkg> test -- --run <path>` (the `--` makes vitest run the whole suite in watch mode). Typecheck: `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`; web `cd apps/web && npx astro check`. `pnpm lint` in every touched package.
- **One migration, in PR A1**: `apps/api/migrations/2026-09-29-ai-agents-graduation-evidence.sql` — the newest COMMITTED migration is `2026-09-28-quickbooks-entity-mappings.sql` (verified via `git ls-files apps/api/migrations | sort | tail`), so this name sorts last today. **Re-verify immediately before opening PR A1 and rename if W06's `2026-09-30-…` landed first** (see Final verification). Idempotent throughout (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` + re-add, `DO $$ … EXCEPTION WHEN duplicate_object`); no inner `BEGIN;`/`COMMIT;` (`autoMigrate` already wraps each file); explicit `ON DELETE` on every FK; never edit a shipped migration — the existing `ai_agent_fix_watches_run_id_uq` UNIQUE **constraint** is replaced by a same-named partial unique **index** via `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` + `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` in the NEW file.
- **Registries for the two new tables** (these contract suites only fail under **Integration Tests**, never **Test API** — a stale base can go green and redden main): `ai_agent_graduation` and `ai_agent_op_evidence` → `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER` (`services/tenantCascade.ts`, alphabetical: both slot between `'ai_agent_fix_watches'` at line 82 and `'ai_agent_runs'` at line 83, graduation first — verified with `localeCompare`), `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY` (`services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts`, alphabetical between the `ai_agent_fix_watches` entry at line 53 and `ai_agent_runs` at line 59), `orgMergeRegistry.ts` `SPECIAL` as `leave-for-erasure`. Both are Shape 1 (`org_id NOT NULL` + `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)`) so they are **auto-discovered by `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` — do NOT add them to any RLS allowlist**. Column add on an already-registered table: `ai_agent_fix_watches.op_keys` / `.intent_id` / `.source_kind` → all three must be classified in that table's `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY` entry (`included`; `op_keys` is `text[]`, not jsonb, so `included` is correct — precedent `ai_agent_schedules.sweep_kinds`). Neither table is append-only, so neither goes in `AUDIT_ADMIN_REQUIRED_TABLES`.
- Policy snapshot `AI_AGENT_POLICY_SNAPSHOT_VERSION` **8 → 9** for the new `promoteThreshold` limit; `schemaVersion: 1 | … | 9`; every read tolerates 1–9 via `?? AI_AGENT_LIMIT_DEFAULTS.promoteThreshold`. `promoteThreshold` is the FIRST limit merged with `Math.max` instead of `Math.min` (a partner raising the bar must not be undercut by an org lowering it) — that exception lives in one named set in `effectivePolicy.ts`, never inline.
- **No `'verdict'` / `'sweep'` / `'narrative'` / `'triage'` profile literal may be introduced into** `services/aiGuardrails.ts`, `services/aiAgents/executionLedger.ts`, `services/actionIntents/policyDecide.ts`, `services/aiAgents/actRevalidation.ts` (`verdictProfile.contract.test.ts:18-22` FORBIDDEN list, regexes at `:27-40`). The evidence namespace literal `'alert_verdict'` does NOT match its `/['"]verdict['"]/` regex (that regex matches the exact quoted word), but none of these four files gains an evidence writer anyway — keep it that way.
- **Leak rules:** no model-authored text in any notification, audit `details`, Sentry tag, or evidence row. Evidence rows carry identifiers only (`op_key`, `rule_id`, ids, timestamps) — never a tool result, alert message, or rationale. The demote notification names the agent and the op key, nothing else (mirror `sendRecurrenceNotifications`, `fixWatch.ts:292-336`).
- **Tenancy invariants:** every new loader predicates by `org_id` explicitly under the system context (RLS passes unconditionally there); every write pins `org_id`; composite same-org FKs make a forged cross-tenant pointer a 23503 even under system context — `(promoted_intent_id, org_id) → action_intents(id, org_id)` (target `action_intents_id_org_uq` exists, `actionIntents.ts:399`), `(run_id, org_id) → ai_agent_runs(id, org_id)` (target `ai_agent_runs_id_org_uq` exists, `aiAgents.ts:161`), `(intent_id, org_id) → action_intents(id, org_id)` on the watch.
- Commit after every task with trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Run `get_feature_status LanternOps/breeze#4187` before starting, and `start_wave` for #4192.
- Branches: PR A1 = `feature/4187-ai-agents-p2/wave-4192` (base main), PR A2 = `feature/4187-ai-agents-p2/wave-4192-a2` (base main, opened after A1 merges), PR B = `feature/4187-ai-agents-p2/wave-4192-b` (base main, opened after A2 merges). All three target **main**, so all three get normal PR CI — do NOT stack them on each other (a PR based on a sibling branch runs no CI at all).

## PR A1 — evidence ledger + intent-anchored watches

### Task 0 (A1-0): Spec + code-comment amendments

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-08-28-ai-agents-phase2-intelligence-layer-design.md` (§4.2 line 102, §4.5 lines 141-162, §5 lines 187-189 + 192, §6 lines 202 + 205)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/intentService.ts` lines 424-439 (the `hasScope` gate's comment)

**Interfaces:** none (documentation only).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Append immediately after §4.5's heading line 141, before the `**Stats.**` paragraph:
```markdown
**Amendment (P2-5 plan, 2026-09-01, quorum):** `ai_agent_op_stats_daily` is DROPPED and replaced by `ai_agent_op_evidence` — one immutable row per outcome, UNIQUE `(source_kind, source_id, metric)`, inserted `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` inside the transaction that terminalizes the outcome. Daily counter buckets cannot be incremented exactly-once under BullMQ redelivery (`count = count + excluded.count` is not idempotent) and a `date` bucket cannot distinguish evidence before and after a same-day `demoted_at`; every aggregate is a GROUP BY over the ledger instead, and a 400-day retention job prunes it. The vocabulary is four metrics, not "success/failure": `executed` (attempted AND the executor reported success), `verified` (`executed` AND a fix-watch reached `held_qualified`, or no eligible watch existed for that source), `failed` (**ATTEMPTED** failure only — the terminal write stamps `executed_at`; revalidation refusals, `session_required`, `connection_unavailable` and pre-execution digest stops are NOT failures), `recurred` (fix-watch `recurred`). Fix watches become **intent-anchored** as well as run-anchored (`intent_id` + partial UNIQUE, `source_kind`, `op_keys[]`) so N independently released intents from one run each get their own verification episode — the run-unique watch mis-attributed them (closes #4206). `ai_agent_graduation` gains a fourth state `tracking`. **Partner `supervisedActionKeys` become a CEILING, not inherited authority**: with no org row the effective key set is `[]` (today `mergeAgentPolicies` returns the partner policy verbatim, `effectivePolicy.ts:135-159`), so an org-level promote is the only thing that makes a key live and an auto-demote actually revokes one. `promoteThreshold` is a new v9 limit merged with `max`, not `min`. Promotion is human-only: `manage_ai_agents` is denied to the `ai_agent` principal in `checkAgentGuardrails`. Four-eyes here means requester + one DIFFERENT approver, first eligible approval wins (`decideApprovalRequest.ts:964-1009`), and the sole-operator WebAuthn self-approval exception (`intentService.ts:574-586`) applies unchanged. Eligibility, promotion and negative evidence all serialize on `pg_advisory_xact_lock` over `(org_id, agent_id, op_key)`.
```
- [ ] **Step 2:** §5 table edits. Replace the `ai_agent_op_stats_daily` row (line 187) with:
```markdown
| `ai_agent_op_evidence` | `id, org_id, agent_id FK ai_agents CASCADE, namespace CHECK IN ('policy_key','act_op','alert_verdict'), op_key text, rule_id uuid NULL (no FK — historical), source_kind CHECK IN ('intent','watch','act_execution','verdict_feedback'), source_id text, metric CHECK IN ('executed','verified','failed','recurred','feedback_up','feedback_down'), run_id NULL composite FK (run_id, org_id) → ai_agent_runs(id, org_id) SET NULL, occurred_at, created_at`; UNIQUE `(source_kind, source_id, metric)`; partial UNIQUE `(source_id) WHERE source_kind = 'verdict_feedback'`; index `(org_id, agent_id, namespace, op_key, occurred_at DESC)` | shape 1; every column `included` | P2-5 |
```
Replace the `ai_agent_graduation` row's state CHECK (line 188) with `CHECK IN ('tracking','eligible','promoted','demoted')` and its `promoted_intent_id` clause with `promoted_intent_id NULL, composite FK (promoted_intent_id, org_id) → action_intents(id, org_id) ON DELETE SET NULL`. Replace the `ai_agent_fix_watches.op_keys` row (line 189) with:
```markdown
| `ai_agent_fix_watches`: `op_keys text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`, `intent_id uuid NULL` (composite FK `(intent_id, org_id) → action_intents(id, org_id)`, partial UNIQUE `(intent_id) WHERE intent_id IS NOT NULL`), `source_kind text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'act_run' CHECK IN ('act_run','intent')`; the existing `run_id` UNIQUE becomes partial `WHERE source_kind = 'act_run'` | column adds → `included` | existing | P2-5 |
```
On line 192, change `promoteThreshold` (20, 5–200)` to `promoteThreshold` (20, 5–200, merged with **max**)` and `snapshot v4 → v5` to `snapshot v8 → v9 (promoteThreshold only)`.
- [ ] **Step 3:** §4.2 line 102 — replace `**Act-mode auto-execution of sweep proposals (the "child run") is deferred to P2-5**` with `**Act-mode auto-execution of sweep proposals (the "child run") is roadmap #4442, NOT P2-5**`. §6 line 202 — replace the Sweep-remediation row's Path cell `existing \`recordProposal\` → auto / inbox / policy-decide` with `existing \`recordProposal\` → supervised inbox card; auto-execution is roadmap #4442`. §6 line 205 — replace `inbox, two approvers` with `inbox; requester + one different approver (first eligible approval wins), human-only principal`.
- [ ] **Step 4:** `intentService.ts` — in the comment block above the `if (args.hasScope) return 'human_required';` gate (lines 424-439), replace the closing sentence `Act-mode auto-execution for sweeps arrives with P2-5, behind its own review, and is expected to REPLACE this line rather than route around it.` with `Act-mode auto-execution for sweeps is roadmap #4442 (explicitly OUT of P2-5, quorum 2026-09-01), behind its own review, and is expected to REPLACE this line rather than route around it.`
- [ ] **Step 5:** `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/actionIntents/intentService` — PASS (comment-only change; confirms nothing pinned the old string).
- [ ] **Step 6:** Commit: `git add docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-08-28-ai-agents-phase2-intelligence-layer-design.md apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/intentService.ts && git commit -m "docs(spec): P2-5 quorum amendments — evidence ledger, partner ceiling, attempted-failure vocabulary, sweep auto-exec to #4442 (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

- `types/aiAgents.ts`: `AiAgentLimits` gains `promoteThreshold: number;` with a doc comment "v9 (P2-5) — verified-evidence count a colon key must reach before it becomes promote-eligible.

Add to the existing shared limits test (find it: `grep -rln 'maxTriageRunsPerHour' packages/shared/src`) assertions that `AI_AGENT_LIMIT_DEFAULTS.promoteThreshold === 20`, `AI_AGENT_POLICY_SNAPSHOT_VERSION === 9`, and that `limitsFields.parse` rejects `promoteThreshold: 4` and `promoteThreshold: 201`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/validators/aiAgentGraduation.test.ts` — expect FAIL (`Cannot find module './aiAgentGraduation'`).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement `types/aiAgentGraduation.ts`, `validators/aiAgentGraduation.ts`, the `aiAgents.ts` / `validators/aiAgents.ts` edits, and both barrel exports.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/validators/aiAgentGraduation.test.ts src/validators/aiAgents.test.ts src/types` — PASS (check the file count is > 0); then `cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add packages/shared && git commit -m "feat(shared): P2-5 evidence/graduation types, promoteThreshold limit, snapshot v9 (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 2 (A1-2): Migration, Drizzle schemas, four registries

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/migrations/2026-09-29-ai-agents-graduation-evidence.sql`, `apps/api/src/db/schema/aiAgentOpEvidence.ts`, `apps/api/src/db/schema/aiAgentGraduation.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/db/schema/aiAgentFixWatches.ts` (columns block lines 20-50, options block lines 51-55), `apps/api/src/db/schema/index.ts` (after line 58), `apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts` (lines 81-83), `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts` (lines 53-59), `apps/api/src/services/orgMergeRegistry.ts` (`SPECIAL`, near the `ai_agent_fix_watches` entry at line 166)

**Interfaces (produced):**
```ts
// apps/api/src/db/schema/aiAgentOpEvidence.ts
export const aiAgentOpEvidence = pgTable('ai_agent_op_evidence', { … });
export type AiAgentOpEvidenceRow = typeof aiAgentOpEvidence.$inferSelect;
export type NewAiAgentOpEvidenceRow = typeof aiAgentOpEvidence.$inferInsert;
// apps/api/src/db/schema/aiAgentGraduation.ts
export const aiAgentGraduation = pgTable('ai_agent_graduation', { … });
export type AiAgentGraduationRow = typeof aiAgentGraduation.$inferSelect;
export type NewAiAgentGraduationRow = typeof aiAgentGraduation.$inferInsert;
// apps/api/src/db/schema/aiAgentFixWatches.ts (added columns)
//   intentId: uuid('intent_id'), sourceKind: text('source_kind').$type<'act_run' | 'intent'>().notNull().default('act_run'),

```
- Drizzle mirrors: `aiAgentOpEvidence` / `aiAgentGraduation` use `pgTable(name, cols, (t) => [ … ])` with `uniqueIndex('…_uq').on(…)` (+ `.where(sql\`…\`)` for the two partial ones) and `index('…').on(…)`, and `foreignKey({ columns, foreignColumns, name }).onDelete('set null')` for the composite FKs — copy the shape from `apps/api/src/db/schema/ticketDrafts.ts`'s composite-FK block. `aiAgentFixWatches.ts` replaces `unique('ai_agent_fix_watches_run_id_uq').on(t.runId)` (line 52) with `uniqueIndex('ai_agent_fix_watches_run_id_uq').on(t.runId).where(sql\`${t.sourceKind} = 'act_run'\`)` and adds `uniqueIndex('ai_agent_fix_watches_intent_uq').on(t.intentId).where(sql\`${t.intentId} IS NOT NULL\`)`.
- Registries: `tenantCascade.ts` — insert `'ai_agent_graduation',` then `'ai_agent_op_evidence',` between lines 82 and 83, each with a one-line comment naming its FKs' explicit `ON DELETE` (the standing comment at lines 74-80 requires it). `tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts` — two new `tablePolicy("org_id", { … })` entries with EVERY column in `included` and empty `reviewedIncluded`/`excludedSensitive`/`excludedOpen`, plus add `"intent_id","source_kind","op_keys"` to the existing `ai_agent_fix_watches` `included` array (line 53). `orgMergeRegistry.ts` `SPECIAL` — two `leave-for-erasure` entries with notes mirroring line 166's reasoning (derived history tied to runs that stay with the source org).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write `apps/api/src/db/schema/aiAgentOpEvidence.registry.test.ts` FIRST asserting: `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER` contains `'ai_agent_graduation'` and `'ai_agent_op_evidence'` exactly once each and is sorted by `localeCompare` with `'organizations'` last; `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY` has an entry for both table names; `orgMergeRegistry.__testOnly.SPECIAL` has both keys with `kind: 'leave-for-erasure'`; and `Object.keys(aiAgentOpEvidence)`/`aiAgentGraduation` include every column named in the migration.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/schema/aiAgentOpEvidence.registry.test.ts` — expect FAIL (module missing).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Write the migration file, both schema files, the `aiAgentFixWatches.ts` edits, the barrel export lines (after `schema/index.ts:58`), and the three registry edits.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/schema/aiAgentOpEvidence.registry.test.ts src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts` — PASS (autoMigrate pins filename ordering and that every `readFileSync`'d migration path resolves). Then apply for real: `export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://breeze:breeze@localhost:5432/breeze" && pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:check-drift` — drift must be clean. Re-run `pnpm db:migrate` a second time to prove idempotency (zero errors, zero changes).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Verify isolation by hand as the unprivileged role: `docker exec -it breeze-postgres psql -U breeze_app -d breeze` then `SET breeze.scope='org'; SET breeze.org_ids='<org A>'; INSERT INTO ai_agent_op_evidence (org_id, agent_id, namespace, op_key, source_kind, source_id, metric, occurred_at) VALUES ('<org B>', …);` — must fail with `new row violates row-level security policy`.
- [ ] **Step 6:** Commit: `git add apps/api/migrations apps/api/src/db apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts apps/api/src/services/orgMergeRegistry.ts && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 schema — op-evidence ledger, graduation state, intent-anchored fix watches (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 3 (A1-3): Canonical key resolver + exactly-once evidence writer

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/canonicalPolicyKey.ts`, `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/opEvidence.ts`, `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/opEvidence.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/policyDecide.ts` (delete the private `canonicalPolicyKey` at lines 67-74, import it instead)

**Interfaces:**
```ts
// apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/canonicalPolicyKey.ts  (leaf module — imports only aiGuardrails)
/** The canonical POLICY_DECIDABLE_TIER3 key for a stored intent's action —
 *  derived EXACTLY the way checkGuardrails/checkAgentGuardrails resolve the
 *  sub-operation (aiGuardrails.ts's `resolveActionForTool`), never a second ad
 *  hoc parse of `arguments`. Moved out of policyDecide.ts (P2-5, #4192) so the
 *  release worker and the evidence writers share ONE definition instead of
 *  rebuilding the string. */
export function canonicalPolicyKey(actionName: string, args: Record<string, unknown>): string;
```
```ts
// apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/opEvidence.ts
import type { AiAgentEvidenceMetric, AiAgentEvidenceNamespace, AiAgentEvidenceSourceKind } from '@breeze/shared';

export interface OpEvidenceInsert {
  orgId: string;
  agentId: string;                       // the EFFECTIVE agent id (partner baseline row) the run recorded
  namespace: AiAgentEvidenceNamespace;
  opKey: string;
  ruleId: string | null;
  sourceKind: AiAgentEvidenceSourceKind;
  sourceId: string;
  metric: AiAgentEvidenceMetric;
  runId: string | null;
  occurredAt: Date;
}

/** Inserts with ON CONFLICT (source_kind, source_id, metric) DO NOTHING and
 *  returns how many rows were actually new. JOINS the caller's ambient DB
 *  context — never opens its own — so it commits atomically with the CAS that
 *  produced the outcome. Callers MUST already be inside a system context. */
export async function insertOpEvidence(rows: OpEvidenceInsert[]): Promise<number>;

/** The single `verdict_feedback` row for a verdict, upserted so a re-vote flips
 *  `metric` in place (up <-> down). Never a negative delta. */
export async function upsertVerdictFeedbackEvidence(row: OpEvidenceInsert): Promise<void>;

/** Stable source ids. Each is deterministic so a redelivered job recomputes the
 *  same value and the unique index absorbs it. */
export function intentEvidenceSourceId(intentId: string): string;                 // `${intentId}`
export function watchEvidenceSourceId(watchId: string, opKey: string): string;    // `${watchId}:${opKey}`
export function actEvidenceSourceId(runId: string, actionIndex: number): string;  // `${runId}:${actionIndex}`
export function verdictEvidenceSourceId(verdictId: string): string;               // `${verdictId}`
```
**Why `watchEvidenceSourceId` includes the op key:** a watch carries N `op_keys` and emits one row per key with the SAME metric, so a bare watch id would collide on `(source_kind, source_id, metric)` and silently drop all but the first key.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write `opEvidence.test.ts` FIRST (Drizzle mock; assert the COMPILED SQL, not the builder object — the repo's vacuous-assertion trap): `insertOpEvidence` emits `on conflict ("source_kind","source_id","metric") do nothing`; it returns `rows.length` on a fresh insert and `0` when the DB returns no rows; a second call with identical inputs produces byte-identical SQL and params; `upsertVerdictFeedbackEvidence` emits `on conflict ("source_id") where "source_kind" = 'verdict_feedback' do update set "metric" = …`; `watchEvidenceSourceId('w1','manage_services:restart') === 'w1:manage_services:restart'`; `actEvidenceSourceId('r1', 0) === 'r1:0'`. Plus a `canonicalPolicyKey.test.ts` asserting `canonicalPolicyKey('manage_services', { action: 'restart' }) === 'manage_services:restart'` and that a tool with no resolvable action returns the bare tool name.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/opEvidence.test.ts src/services/actionIntents/canonicalPolicyKey.test.ts` — expect FAIL (modules missing).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement both modules; move `canonicalPolicyKey` out of `policyDecide.ts` and replace its body there with the import (its call site at `policyDecide.ts:534` is unchanged).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/opEvidence src/services/actionIntents/canonicalPolicyKey src/services/actionIntents/policyDecide` — PASS. Then `npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/verdictProfile.contract.test.ts` — PASS (confirms `policyDecide.ts` gained no forbidden literal).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/services && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 exactly-once op-evidence writer + shared canonical policy-key resolver (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 4 (A1-4): Release-worker terminalization + intent evidence

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts` (`failIntent` lines 237-257, the returned-tool-error CAS lines 629-645, the success CAS lines 665-690) and `apps/api/src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.test.ts`.

**Interfaces (produced, module-private to the worker):**
```ts
/** Runs a terminal CAS and, only when it WINS, the evidence write, inside ONE
 *  outer system transaction. transitionIntent opens its own
 *  withSystemDbAccessContext (intentService.ts:1929), and a nested context
 *  JOINS an ambient one (db/index.ts:526-528), so both land in one commit.
 *  NEVER wraps executeTool — the worker deliberately executes outside any DB
 *  context (intentReleaseWorker.ts:533-575). */
async function terminalizeIntent(
  intent: ActionIntent,
  to: 'completed' | 'failed',
  patch: { executedAt?: Date | null; errorCode?: string; result?: Record<string, unknown> },
  onWon?: () => Promise<void>,
): Promise<boolean>;

/** True iff this terminal write represents an ATTEMPTED operation. The
 *  discriminator is already in the codebase and already documented: a terminal
 *  write stamps `executed_at` exactly when the provider-side effect happened
 *  (failIntent's `executed: true`, intentReleaseWorker.ts:229-236). */
function isAttemptedTerminal(patch: { executedAt?: Date | null }): boolean;
```
**Terminal-branch inventory — every exit of `releaseApprovedIntent`, with its C4 classification (verified line by line in this file):**

| Line | Branch | Terminal write | Attempted? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 317-325 | claim CAS `approved→executing` lost | none (silent return) | — | none |
| 291 | `failOnPlaintextSecretGuard` → `failIntent(SECRET_SEAL_INVARIANT_VIOLATED_ERROR_CODE, { executed: true })` | `failed`, `executedAt` set | **YES** | `failed` |
| 386 | kill switch on revalidation → `pauseIntentForKillSwitch` | `executing→approved` (not terminal) | — | none |
| 389 | revalidation stop (digest bound / tier / actor / org / rbac / policy) | `failed`, no `executedAt` | no | none |
| 472 | `digest_check_failed` (recompute threw) | `failed`, no `executedAt` | no | none |
| 481 | `content_changed` (digest mismatch) | `failed`, no `executedAt` | no | none |
| 499 | `session_required` | `failed`, no `executedAt` | no | none |
| 525 | pre-dispatch kill read → `pauseIntentForKillSwitch` | `executing→approved` | — | none |
| 583 | `connection_unavailable` (no API call was made) | `failed`, no `executedAt` | no | none |
| 589 | `execution_error` (executor threw) `{ executed: true }` | `failed`, `executedAt` set | **YES** | `failed` |
| 629 | `tool_returned_error` (error body, not a throw) | `failed`, `executedAt` set | **YES** | `failed` |
| 665 | success | `completed`, `executedAt` set | **YES** | `executed` (+ `verified` when no watch is created — Task 5) |

The rule reduces to: **evidence is written iff the terminal write stamps `executedAt`**; `completed → executed`, `failed → failed`. `failIntent`'s existing `executed?: boolean` option IS the attempted flag — do not invent a second classifier.

**Evidence payload for an intent terminal (agent-originated only — `intent.requestingAgentRunId` non-null; a human/chat/MCP intent produces no agent evidence):** load the run row (`ai_agent_runs.agent_id`, `.alert_id`) inside the same transaction; `namespace: 'policy_key'`, `opKey: canonicalPolicyKey(intent.actionName, intent.arguments)`, `ruleId: null`, `sourceKind: 'intent'`, `sourceId: intentEvidenceSourceId(intent.id)`, `runId: intent.requestingAgentRunId`, `occurredAt: new Date()`, `agentId: run.agentId`, `orgId: intent.orgId`.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests in `intentReleaseWorker.test.ts`: a table-driven case per row above asserting `insertOpEvidence` is called with the exact metric (or not called at all) — one case per branch, twelve cases, using the branch's real trigger (mock `revalidateApprovedIntentForRelease`, `executeTool`, `readAiKillState`); a redelivery case (`releaseApprovedIntent` called twice for the same id) asserting the second call writes nothing because the claim CAS loses; a case asserting evidence is NOT written when `intent.requestingAgentRunId` is null; a case asserting `insertOpEvidence` is never called when the terminal CAS returns false.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.test.ts` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement `terminalizeIntent` + `isAttemptedTerminal`; route the three attempted terminal writes (`failIntent`'s `executed: true` calls, the `tool_returned_error` CAS at 629, the success CAS at 665) through it. Leave `auditReleaseFailure` / `recordActionIntentEvent` OUTSIDE the transaction, exactly where they are today.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker src/services/actionIntents/intentService` — PASS; then `npx vitest run src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.durable.contract.test.ts` — PASS (no new terminal writer was introduced).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts apps/api/src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.test.ts && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 intent terminalization writes op evidence in the CAS transaction (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 5 (A1-5): Intent-anchored fix watches + durable enqueue recovery

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/fixWatch.ts` (add beside `createFixWatchRow` at lines 132-182), `apps/api/src/jobs/fixWatchWorker.ts` (`scheduleFixWatch` lines 131-146, `processFixWatchJob` lines 155-…, `initializeFixWatchWorker`), `apps/api/src/jobs/queueSchemas.ts` (line 321-324), `apps/api/src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts`, and the two workers' `.test.ts` files.

**Interfaces:**
```ts
// fixWatch.ts
export interface IntentForWatch {
  intentId: string; orgId: string; runId: string; agentId: string;
  alertId: string; opKey: string;                 // colon key from canonicalPolicyKey
}
/** Sibling of createFixWatchRow for a released INTENT rather than an act run.
 *  createFixWatchRow rejects anything but an act-mode, execution-succeeded,
 *  verification-passed RUN (fixWatch.ts:112-121) and cannot be reused. Reuses
 *  the same alert/device denormalisation (rule_id, device_id,
 *  config_item_name from the TRIGGERING ALERT ROW, org-predicated) and the
 *  same partner resolution; writes source_kind 'intent', op_keys [opKey].
 *  JOINS the caller's ambient system transaction. Returns the watch id, or
 *  null when the alert is unreadable in this org or the org has no partner. */
export async function createIntentFixWatchRow(input: IntentForWatch): Promise<string | null>;

// fixWatchWorker.ts
/** Now returns the watch id it created (or null) so finishRun can tell whether
 *  an act run's executions will ever be verified by a watch. */
export async function scheduleFixWatch(run: FinishedRunForWatch, outcome: FixWatchOutcomeInput): Promise<string | null>;
/** Re-enqueues phase-1 for any `pending` watch older than PENDING_RECOVERY_MS
 *  whose job was lost (the enqueue is post-commit, so a crash between commit
 *  and add() strands the row). The jobId is stable
 *  (`getFixWatchPhase1JobId`), so a duplicate add is a no-op. */
export async function recoverStrandedFixWatches(): Promise<number>;
export const PENDING_RECOVERY_MS = 2 * 60 * 1000;
```
- `queueSchemas.ts`: `fixWatchQueueJobDataSchema` becomes a discriminated union on `phase`:
```ts
export const fixWatchQueueJobDataSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('phase', [
  z.object({ phase: z.literal('phase1'), watchId: z.string().min(1) }).strict(),
  z.object({ phase: z.literal('phase2'), watchId: z.string().min(1) }).strict(),
  z.object({ phase: z.literal('recover') }).strict(),
]);
```
The `recover` variant rides the EXISTING `fix-watch` queue and `check-fix-watch` job name, so `assertQueueJobName` is unchanged and **no `workerRegistry.ts` entry is added** (which would force `EXPECTED_NAMES` + the hard-coded `115` count in `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts:453` to change). Register it in `initializeFixWatchWorker` with `repeat: { every: PENDING_RECOVERY_MS }` and `jobId: 'fix-watch-recover'`; 2 minutes is far below `COARSE_REPEAT_INTERVAL_MS`, so `scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts` needs no slot.
- `intentReleaseWorker.ts` success branch: inside `terminalizeIntent`'s `onWon`, after the evidence insert, when the run has an `alertId` call `createIntentFixWatchRow`; capture the returned id. When it is `null` (no eligible watch), ALSO insert the `verified` metric for the same `sourceId` immediately (C4's "no eligible watch existed for the source"). **Enqueue AFTER the transaction commits** — `bullmqQueue.ts:52-58` `assertOutsideHeldDbContext` throws if `queue.add` runs inside a held context. Use the existing `enqueueFixWatchCheck('phase1', watchId, PHASE1_RECHECK_DELAY_MS)` with its stable jobId.
- `runLoop.ts` act-run watch: `createFixWatchRow` also snapshots `opKeys: outcome.executedActions.map(a => a.actOpKey).filter(Boolean)` (dot keys, `runLoop.ts:213`) and `sourceKind: 'act_run'`. Its `.onConflictDoNothing({ target: aiAgentFixWatches.runId })` (line 177) MUST gain the index predicate or Postgres cannot infer the now-partial index: `.onConflictDoNothing({ target: aiAgentFixWatches.runId, where: sql\`${aiAgentFixWatches.sourceKind} = 'act_run'\` })` — drizzle 0.45.2 renders this as `on conflict ("run_id") where … do nothing` (`insert.js:107`).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: `createIntentFixWatchRow` writes `source_kind='intent'`, `op_keys=[opKey]`, and denormalises `rule_id`/`device_id`/`config_item_name` from an alert row read with BOTH `id` and `org_id` predicates; it returns null when the alert belongs to another org; two calls for the same intent id insert one row (partial unique). `createFixWatchRow`'s compiled SQL contains `on conflict ("run_id") where`. `scheduleFixWatch` returns the watch id. `recoverStrandedFixWatches` re-enqueues only `pending` watches older than 2 minutes and uses the phase-1 jobId. In `intentReleaseWorker.test.ts`: a successful agent intent whose run HAS an alertId creates a watch and writes only `executed`; one whose run has NO alertId writes `executed` AND `verified`; the watch enqueue happens after the transaction (assert `queue.add` is called after the transaction callback resolves, and that no `assertOutsideHeldDbContext` error is thrown).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/fixWatch src/jobs/fixWatchWorker src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement all of the above.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run the same command — PASS; then `npx vitest run src/services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` — PASS (`intentReleaseWorker` is `socket-owner` and `fixWatchWorker` is `global`; the test only forbids a GLOBAL entrypoint reaching socket-local dispatch, `:451-473`, so a socket-owner importing the global producer is fine — but run it, do not assume).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 intent-anchored fix watches with durable enqueue recovery (#4192, closes #4206)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 6 (A1-6): Watch-verdict evidence + act-op evidence

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/fixWatch.ts` (`checkFixWatchPhase2` lines 382-447: the `recurred` CAS at 411-418 and the `held_qualified` CAS at 427-432), `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/runLoop.ts` (`finishRun`, the `watches && status === 'completed'` block at lines 2562-2573), and both `.test.ts` files.

**Interfaces:** no new exports. Evidence payloads:
- **Watch verdict** (inside the WINNING CAS's transaction, before it returns; notify stays after commit exactly as today at `fixWatch.ts:439-446`): one row per entry of `watch.opKeys`, `namespace: watch.sourceKind === 'intent' ? 'policy_key' : 'act_op'`, `opKey: <entry>`, `ruleId: watch.ruleId`, `sourceKind: 'watch'`, `sourceId: watchEvidenceSourceId(watch.id, entry)`, `metric: 'recurred' | 'verified'`, `runId: watch.runId`, `occurredAt: new Date()`, `agentId: watch.agentId`, `orgId: watch.orgId`. A watch with an empty `op_keys` writes nothing (pre-P2-5 rows).
- **Act execution** (in `finishRun`, after the terminal CAS is won — `finishRun` returns early on `!moved`, so this section runs at most once per winning executor): for each `outcome.executedActions[i]` with an `actOpKey`, `namespace: 'act_op'`, `opKey: action.actOpKey`, `ruleId: null`, `sourceKind: 'act_execution'`, `sourceId: actEvidenceSourceId(run.id, i)`, `runId: run.id`, `occurredAt: new Date()`. Metric mapping: `execution === 'succeeded'` → `executed`; `execution === 'failed'` OR `verification === 'failed'` → `failed`; `verification` of `inconclusive`/`skipped` → nothing extra. When `scheduleFixWatch` returned `null` (no watch will ever verify this run), each `executed` action ALSO gets a `verified` row with the same `sourceId`.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests. `fixWatch.test.ts`: a `recurred` verdict on a watch with `op_keys = ['a:b','c:d']` inserts two `recurred` rows with source ids `<watchId>:a:b` / `<watchId>:c:d`; a LOST CAS (`moved` empty) inserts nothing; `held_qualified` inserts `verified` per key; an intent watch uses namespace `policy_key`, an act watch `act_op`; notification still fires only after the transaction. `runLoop.test.ts`: two executed actions with distinct `actOpKey`s (non-uniform fixture — different tool AND different verification per action, so a wrong-index bug surfaces) produce the right metric per index; a run where `scheduleFixWatch` returns null gets `executed` + `verified`; one where it returns an id gets `executed` only; `!moved` writes nothing.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/fixWatch src/services/aiAgents/runLoop` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run the same command — PASS (check the file count; `runLoop.test.ts` is large, use `--pool=threads --maxWorkers=2` if a stack is up).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/services/aiAgents && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 watch-verdict and act-execution op evidence (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 7 (A1-7): Verdict feedback evidence

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/alertVerdicts.ts` (`recordVerdictFeedback`, lines 603-623) and `alertVerdicts.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** `recordVerdictFeedback`'s signature and `RecordVerdictFeedbackResult` union are UNCHANGED. Rewrite the body as: one `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the verdict row (`id`, `orgId`, `runId`, `alertId`, `correlationGroupId`, `feedback`, `feedbackBy`, `createdAt`) → not found ⇒ `{ status: 'not_found' }`; `feedbackBy` set and ≠ `auth.user.id` ⇒ `{ status: 'conflict', orgId }` (**preserve the existing rule at `alertVerdicts.ts:612-615`: a different user may never overwrite; the same user changing their mind is fine**); otherwise UPDATE the verdict and upsert the single evidence row. The request already runs inside `withDbAccessContext`, so all of this joins that ambient transaction — do not open a new one.

**Evidence payload:** `namespace: 'alert_verdict'`, `opKey: AI_AGENT_ALERT_VERDICT_OP_KEY`, `metric: feedback === 'up' ? 'feedback_up' : 'feedback_down'`, `sourceKind: 'verdict_feedback'`, `sourceId: verdictEvidenceSourceId(verdictId)`, `runId: verdict.runId`, `occurredAt: verdict.createdAt` (the FIXED bucket — the verdict's own creation, not the vote's), `agentId`: from `ai_agent_runs.agent_id` for `verdict.runId`, `orgId: verdict.orgId`. `ruleId`: `alerts.rule_id` for `verdict.alertId`; for a group verdict, the rule of `alert_correlation_groups.root_alert_id` (`alerts.ts:141`), NULL when the group has no root or the alert row is gone. Superseded verdicts keep accepting feedback (unchanged, and `ai_alert_verdicts` has no state gate on it). **No backfill of historical votes** — pre-P2-5 feedback simply has no evidence row; say so in the docstring.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: an up-vote inserts one `feedback_up` row with `occurred_at = verdict.created_at`; the same user re-voting `down` UPDATEs that row's metric to `feedback_down` and leaves exactly one row (assert the compiled `on conflict ("source_id") where "source_kind" = 'verdict_feedback' do update`); a different user gets `{ status: 'conflict' }` and NO evidence write; a missing verdict gets `{ status: 'not_found' }` and no write; a group verdict resolves `rule_id` through `root_alert_id`; a group with `root_alert_id` null yields `ruleId: null`; the SELECT is `FOR UPDATE` (assert the compiled SQL contains `for update`).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/alertVerdicts` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/alertVerdicts src/routes/aiAgents` — PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/alertVerdicts.ts apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/alertVerdicts.test.ts && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 verdict feedback writes a single locked evidence row (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 8 (A1-8): `updateAgent` row lock

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/agentService.ts` (`updateAgent` lines 470-533; `getAgent` lines 378-396 stays as-is) and `agentService.test.ts`.

**Interfaces (produced):**
```ts
/** SELECT … FOR UPDATE on one ai_agents row, bound by the SAME
 *  accessibleAgentCondition(auth) predicate getAgent uses (agentService.ts:392),
 *  then runs `fn` with the locked row inside the caller's ambient transaction.
 *  Every writer of actAssets — updateAgent (here), promote and demote
 *  (supervisedKeyGrant.ts, PR A2) — goes through this. A read-modify-write of
 *  the jsonb without it loses a concurrent key append. */
export async function withAgentRowLocked<T>(
  auth: AuthContext | null,           // null = system caller (promote/demote): predicate by id + orgId instead
  id: string,
  fn: (row: AiAgentRow) => Promise<T>,
): Promise<T>;
```
`updateAgent` becomes: `withAgentRowLocked(auth, id, async (existing) => { … existing body from line 476 onward, ending with the same UPDATE … })`. The `disabledAt`/`assertAgentWriteAllowed` checks move inside the callback so they read the locked row.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: `withAgentRowLocked` compiles to a SELECT containing `for update` AND the accessible-agent predicate (assert the compiled SQL includes both `for update` and `org_id`); `updateAgent` calls it before validating and updating (assert call order via a spy); a disabled row inside the lock still throws `AgentAccessDeniedError`; the existing `updateAgent` test suite still passes unchanged.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/agentService` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/agentService src/routes/aiAgents` — PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/agentService.ts apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/agentService.test.ts && git commit -m "fix(api): lock the ai_agents row across every actAssets read-modify-write (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 9 (A1-9): Evidence retention worker

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker.ts`, `apps/api/src/jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.ts` (`JOB_SCHEDULES` daily tier, after `'ai-unattended-exposure-retention': '8 18 * * *'` at the end of the daily block), `apps/api/src/services/workerRegistry.ts` (append an entry after `aiAgentSweepScheduler`), `apps/api/src/services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` (`EXPECTED_NAMES` at line 272, and the `expect(entries.length).toBe(115)` sanity count at line 453 → 116)

**Interfaces:**
```ts
// apps/api/src/jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker.ts
export const AI_AGENT_GRADUATION_QUEUE = 'ai-agent-graduation';
export const AI_AGENT_GRADUATION_JOB_NAME = 'ai-agent-graduation';
/** Discriminated so PR A2 can add `{ task: 'evaluate' }` to the SAME queue and
 *  worker without a second workerRegistry entry. */
export type AiAgentGraduationJobData = { task: 'prune-evidence' };
export async function pruneOpEvidence(): Promise<{ deletedCount: number; durationMs: number }>;
export async function initializeAiAgentGraduationWorker(): Promise<void>;
export async function shutdownAiAgentGraduationWorker(): Promise<void>;
```
- Copy the structure of `apps/api/src/jobs/aiUnattendedExposureRetention.ts` verbatim (its `runWithSystemDbAccess` guard, `extractRowCount`, `recordRetentionRun`, `attachWorkerObservability`, `jobSchedule(...)`). The prune is `DELETE FROM ai_agent_op_evidence WHERE occurred_at < <cutoff ISO string>::timestamptz` with `cutoff = now - AI_AGENT_EVIDENCE_RETENTION_DAYS days`; pass the cutoff as an ISO **string**, not a `Date` (postgres-js does not coerce Date in template params — the sibling workers' convention).
- `scheduleRegistry.ts`: add `'ai-agent-op-evidence-retention': '48 18 * * *',`. That minute is ≡ 3 (mod 5) as the daily tier requires and no other job holds `(18, 48)` — `scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts` asserts one slot per job, no duplicate patterns, and no two coarse schedules in the same minute.
- `workerRegistry.ts`: `{ name: 'aiAgentGraduation', placement: 'global', load: async () => { const m = await import('../jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker'); return { init: m.initializeAiAgentGraduationWorker, shutdown: m.shutdownAiAgentGraduationWorker }; } }` with a comment stating the closure reaches only `db` + `services/aiAgents/opEvidence.ts` and must never import `aiTools.ts` (the promotion executor lives there and would drag socket-local dispatch in).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: `pruneOpEvidence` emits a DELETE whose predicate is `occurred_at < $1::timestamptz` with a cutoff 400 days back (assert the compiled SQL and the param); it returns the extracted row count; `initializeAiAgentGraduationWorker` registers the repeatable with `pattern: jobSchedule('ai-agent-op-evidence-retention')` and a fixed `jobId`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker.test.ts` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement the worker + the three registry edits (including bumping the `115` literal).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts src/services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` — PASS (all three; the closure test will fail loudly if `global` is the wrong placement and names the offending import chain).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 op-evidence retention worker (400d) (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 10 (A1-10): Live-Postgres proof (exactly-once, RLS, erasure, merge)

**Files:** Create `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/aiAgentOpEvidence.integration.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** none (test only). It must live under `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/` or it runs in ZERO CI jobs.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write the suite. It must prove:
  1. **Exactly-once under redelivery** — `releaseApprovedIntent(id)` invoked twice against a real DB leaves exactly one `executed` evidence row (the second call loses the claim CAS); `insertOpEvidence` called twice with identical inputs leaves one row and returns `0` the second time.
  2. **Atomicity** — force the evidence insert to throw inside `terminalizeIntent` and assert the intent stays `executing` (the CAS rolled back), not `completed` with no evidence.
  3. **Watch fan-out** — a watch with two `op_keys` reaching `recurred` writes exactly two rows; running phase 2 twice writes no third row.
  4. **RLS forge** — as `breeze_app` under org A's context, an INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT naming org B's `org_id` fails `42501` on both new tables; the composite FK forge (a `promoted_intent_id` from another org) fails `23503`.
  5. **Erasure** — deleting an org with rows in both tables succeeds via the tenant-cascade path (no FK abort, no stranded rows).
  6. **Org merge** — merging an org with rows in both tables succeeds and leaves the rows on the loser shell (`leave-for-erasure`).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Bring up the wave's DB: `docker compose -p breeze-test-ai-agents-p2-5 -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d postgres` (mirror P2-2/P2-4's harness naming), then run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/aiAgentOpEvidence.integration.test.ts` — expect FAIL first (assertions 1-3 before Tasks 3-6 land are already green from earlier tasks, so run this AFTER them and expect 4-6 to fail until the registries are right).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Fix whatever fails, then run the registry contract suites against the same DB: `npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenantCascade.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/orgMergeRegistry.integration.test.ts` — ALL PASS.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Full API typecheck: `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`; `pnpm lint` in `apps/api` and `packages/shared`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/__tests__ && git commit -m "test(api): P2-5 live-Postgres proof — exactly-once evidence, RLS forge, erasure, merge (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`; then run the **Final verification** checklist below and open **PR A1** targeting main with body `Part of #4192`. STOP at the open PR.

## PR A2 — graduation, promotion, demotion (branch `feature/4187-ai-agents-p2/wave-4192-a2`, base main, opened after A1 merges)

### Task 11 (A2-1): Partner keys become a ceiling

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/effectivePolicy.ts` (`mergeLimits` lines 70-99, the `if (!org)` fast path lines 135-159, the `actAssets` merge lines 245-266), `effectivePolicy.test.ts` (the pinned assertion at lines 367-374), `docs/deploy/ai-kill-switch.md` (the operator runbook that already documents the policy-decide lane — `docs/deploy/` has no dedicated policy-decide file, verified); create `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/effectivePolicy.ceiling.contract.test.ts`.

**Interfaces (produced):**
```ts
/** Limit keys merged with Math.max instead of Math.min. Everything else is
 *  tighten-only (the org may only narrow). `promoteThreshold` is a BAR, not a
 *  budget: a partner who requires 50 verified executions must not be undercut
 *  by an org row asking for 5. */
const MAX_MERGED_LIMIT_KEYS: ReadonlySet<keyof AiAgentLimits> = new Set(['promoteThreshold']);
```
**Behaviour change (C3, release-blocking):** in the `if (!org)` fast path, `actAssets.supervisedActionKeys` resolves to `[]` — joining `anomalyEnabled` and `ticketAutonomousWrites` as a field the partner baseline alone can never turn on. The `org` branch is unchanged (`intersect(partner ?? [], org ?? [])`, line 262-265). Docstring must say: partner keys are a CEILING (what an org MAY be granted), the org row is the GRANT (what it HAS); promotion is the only writer that adds one, demotion the only one that removes one. Safe to land now because `attemptPolicyDecision` is the sole consumer and `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED` is off in production (`policyDecide.ts:501-508` re-reads it live).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Update the pinned test at `effectivePolicy.test.ts:367-374` — the "No org override at all: effective === partner verbatim" case now asserts `{ scriptIds: [], supervisedActionKeys: [] }` and its comment is rewritten to state the ceiling rule. Then write `effectivePolicy.ceiling.contract.test.ts` FIRST with: no org row + partner `[KEY_A]` ⇒ `[]`; org row present ⇒ intersection (unchanged); org row with a key the partner lacks ⇒ dropped; `mergeLimits` returns `max(partner, org)` for `promoteThreshold` and `min` for every other numeric (table-driven over `AI_AGENT_LIMIT_DEFAULTS`'s keys, so a future limit added to the max set fails loudly); a v8 snapshot with no `promoteThreshold` reads the default 20.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/effectivePolicy` — expect FAIL (check the file count picks up BOTH `effectivePolicy.test.ts` and `effectivePolicy.ceiling.contract.test.ts`; a trailing slash or an asterisk would silently skip siblings).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement `MAX_MERGED_LIMIT_KEYS` in `mergeLimits` and the `[]` in the `!org` fast path.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/effectivePolicy src/services/actionIntents/policyDecide src/services/aiAgents/runService` — PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Add a section to `docs/deploy/ai-kill-switch.md` under its policy-decide bullet: before flipping `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED` on, every org that should hold a supervised key needs an org-level `ai_agents` row carrying it — as of P2-5 a partner-only baseline is a ceiling and grants nothing. Commit: `git add apps/api/src/services/aiAgents docs/deploy/ai-kill-switch.md && git commit -m "fix(api): partner supervisedActionKeys are a ceiling, not an inherited grant (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 12 (A2-2): Graduation service — window, eligibility, state machine

**Files:** Create `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.ts`, `graduationService.test.ts`.

**Interfaces (produced):**
```ts
import type {
  AiAgentGraduationBlockedReason, AiAgentGraduationRowDto, AiAgentGraduationState,
  AiAgentGraduationWindow, AiAgentActOpReliabilityDto,
} from '@breeze/shared';

export interface GraduationEvaluation {
  opKey: string;
  state: AiAgentGraduationState;
  window: AiAgentGraduationWindow;
  blockedReason: AiAgentGraduationBlockedReason | null;
}

/** Pure over the evidence ledger + the current graduation row. Window =
 *  evidence with occurred_at > GREATEST(now() - 30 days, graduation.demoted_at)
 *  — timestamps, never day buckets, so a demotion and a re-verification on the
 *  same day are unambiguous. Only namespace 'policy_key' rows count. */
export async function evaluateGraduation(
  orgId: string, agentId: string, opKey: string,
): Promise<GraduationEvaluation>;

/** Recomputes and PERSISTS the graduation row for one tuple under
 *  pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('ai_agent_graduation'), hashtext(orgId||agentId||opKey)).
 *  Called by the daily job and by the read route. Never promotes or demotes —
 *  it only moves tracking <-> eligible and resets first_verified_at on the
 *  first `verified` after demoted_at. */
export async function refreshGraduationRow(
  orgId: string, agentId: string, opKey: string,
): Promise<GraduationEvaluation>;

/** Every (org, agent, op_key) with at least one policy_key evidence row in the
 *  trailing 30 days — the daily job's work list. */
export async function listTrackedTuples(): Promise<Array<{ orgId: string; agentId: string; opKey: string }>>;

/** Rows + act-op reliability for one resolved agent, for the read route. */
export async function loadGraduationRows(orgId: string, agentId: string): Promise<AiAgentGraduationRowDto[]>;
export async function loadActOpReliability(orgId: string, agentId: string): Promise<AiAgentActOpReliabilityDto[]>;

/** Advisory-lock helper shared by this module, the promote executor and the
 *  demote path. Must run inside a transaction (xact lock releases on commit). */
export async function withGraduationLock<T>(
  orgId: string, agentId: string, opKey: string, fn: () => Promise<T>,
): Promise<T>;
```
**Eligibility rule (all must hold; `blockedReason` is the FIRST failing check, in this order):**
1. `isPolicyDecidableKey(opKey)` (`policyDecidable.ts`) else `'not_policy_decidable'`.
2. The key is in the PARTNER row's `actAssets.supervisedActionKeys` (read the partner baseline for the org's partner in a system context) else `'needs_partner_baseline'`.
3. `window.failed === 0 && window.recurred === 0` else `'has_failures'`.
4. `window.verified >= effective.limits.promoteThreshold ?? AI_AGENT_LIMIT_DEFAULTS.promoteThreshold` else `'below_threshold'`.
5. `now - window.firstVerifiedAt >= AI_AGENT_GRADUATION_MIN_AGE_DAYS` else `'too_recent'`.
If all hold and the key is already in the ORG row's `supervisedActionKeys`, state is `promoted` (not `eligible`) with `blockedReason: null`. `window.firstVerifiedAt` = `MIN(occurred_at)` over `verified` rows in the window.
**Transitions:** `tracking → eligible` (job or read, when 1-5 hold); `eligible → tracking` (the window slid and a check now fails); `eligible → promoted` (promote intent executed, Task 15); `promoted → demoted` (Task 16); `demoted → tracking` on the first `verified` row with `occurred_at > demoted_at` (which also resets `first_verified_at`).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write `graduationService.test.ts` FIRST (Drizzle mock, compiled-SQL assertions where a predicate matters): the window query's lower bound is `GREATEST(now() - interval '30 days', demoted_at)` and it filters `namespace = 'policy_key'`; each blocked reason fires in the documented precedence (a key that is both not-policy-decidable and below threshold reports `'not_policy_decidable'`); `verified === promoteThreshold` is eligible but `promoteThreshold - 1` is `'below_threshold'`; `firstVerifiedAt` exactly 14 days ago is eligible, 13 days 23 h is `'too_recent'`; a key already in the org row reports `promoted`; `withGraduationLock` emits `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext($1), hashtext($2))` with the two expected arguments; `refreshGraduationRow` after a demotion ignores evidence at or before `demoted_at` and resets `first_verified_at` on the first later `verified`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.test.ts` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/graduationService` — PASS.

### Task 13 (A2-3): Daily graduation evaluation job

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker.ts` (widen `AiAgentGraduationJobData` and the processor), `apps/api/src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.ts`, `aiAgentGraduationWorker.test.ts`.

**Interfaces (produced):**
```ts
export type AiAgentGraduationJobData = { task: 'prune-evidence' } | { task: 'evaluate' };
/** Refreshes every tuple listTrackedTuples() returns, each under its own
 *  advisory-locked transaction so one slow tuple never blocks the rest and a
 *  failure mid-sweep leaves the already-refreshed rows committed. */
export async function evaluateAllGraduations(): Promise<{ tuples: number; changed: number; durationMs: number }>;
```
- `scheduleRegistry.ts`: add `'ai-agent-graduation-evaluate': '28 18 * * *',` to the daily tier. Minute 28 ≡ 3 (mod 5); `(18, 28)` is unused (`(18, 8)` is `ai-unattended-exposure-retention`, `(18, 48)` is A1's retention slot).
- No new `workerRegistry.ts` entry and no change to the `116` count — this rides A1's queue and worker.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: `evaluateAllGraduations` calls `refreshGraduationRow` once per tuple and counts state changes; a throw on one tuple does not abort the others (assert the remaining tuples still ran and the error was captured); the processor dispatches on `task`; `initializeAiAgentGraduationWorker` now registers TWO repeatables with distinct jobIds and the two registry patterns.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker.test.ts` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/aiAgentGraduationWorker src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts src/services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` — PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/jobs && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 daily graduation evaluation repeatable (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 14 (A2-4): `manage_ai_agents:authorize_supervised_key` — every wiring point

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsAiAgentGovernance.ts`, `aiToolsAiAgentGovernance.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiTools.ts` (import block lines 31-86, registration block lines 255-304), `aiToolSchemas.ts` (`toolInputSchemas`, line 97+), `aiAgentSdkTools.ts` (`TOOL_TIERS` lines 115-283, the `tools` array inside `createBreezeMcpServer` at line 1085), `aiGuardrails.ts` (`TIER3_FOUR_EYES_ACTIONS` lines 309-330, `TIER3_FOUR_EYES_TOOLS` line 333+, `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` line 503+, `TOOL_RATE_LIMITS` line 1075+, `buildApprovalDescription` line 1935+, `checkAgentGuardrails` lines 1621-1626), `aiGuardrails.approvalScope.contract.test.ts` (the pinned arrays at lines 176-178 and 185), `services/actionIntents/effectDigest.ts` (`EFFECT_DIGEST_RESOLVERS` lines 117-319), `apps/web/src/components/ai-risk/tierConfig.ts` (`TIER_DEFINITIONS` tier-3 block line 193+, `RBAC_MAPPINGS` line 335+), `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/ai.mdx` (tier table lines 27-32, four-eyes bullet list lines 59-68)

**Interfaces (produced):**
```ts
// apps/api/src/services/aiToolsAiAgentGovernance.ts
// Deliberately NOT named aiToolsAgentMgmt.ts — that module is ENDPOINT-agent
// management (query_agent_versions / trigger_agent_upgrade / trigger_agent_restart).
export function registerAiAgentGovernanceTools(aiTools: Map<string, AiTool>): void;
```
**The tool:** name `manage_ai_agents`, `tier: 3`, one action `authorize_supervised_key`, arguments `{ action: 'authorize_supervised_key', kind: AiAgentKind, opKey: string }`. **No `orgId` argument** — the org comes from the intent's own `org_id`, and the agent id is resolved server-side by `resolveEffectiveAgentSystem(orgId, kind)` (`effectivePolicy.ts:309`), never trusted from arguments.

**Every mandatory wiring item (omit one and it fails differently — the failure mode is listed):**
1. `aiTools.ts`: `import { registerAiAgentGovernanceTools } from './aiToolsAiAgentGovernance';` + `registerAiAgentGovernanceTools(aiTools);` beside `registerAgentMgmtTools(aiTools);` (line 300). Omitted ⇒ `executeTool`/`getToolTier` never see the tool. Do NOT edit `aiToolNames.ts`.
2. `aiToolSchemas.ts` `toolInputSchemas`: `manage_ai_agents: z.object({ action: z.enum(['authorize_supervised_key']), kind: z.enum(AI_AGENT_KINDS), opKey: z.string().min(3).max(120) })`. Omitted ⇒ `validateToolInput` rejects every call (`aiToolSchemas.ts:1658-1666` fails closed).
3. `aiAgentSdkTools.ts`: `TOOL_TIERS.manage_ai_agents = 3` AND an explicit `tool('manage_ai_agents', …, makeHandler('manage_ai_agents', getAuth, onPreToolUse, onPostToolUse))` in the `tools` array — copy the `manage_organizations` block at `:2241-2253`, NOT `manage_tickets` (which has a schema and permissions but no tier and no `tool()`, and is therefore unreachable from chat/MCP — the exact bug `aiAgentSdkTools.ts:2256-2261` documents). Omitted ⇒ `aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts` fails, and its `KNOWN_MISSING_TOOL_TIERS` set may only SHRINK, so the name must never be added there.
4. `aiGuardrails.ts` `TIER3_FOUR_EYES_ACTIONS`: `manage_ai_agents: ['authorize_supervised_key'],`. `TIER3_FOUR_EYES_TOOLS`: `'manage_ai_agents',` (whole-tool fail-safe: any future action defaults to four_eyes rather than the weaker supervised).
5. `aiGuardrails.ts` `TOOL_PERMISSIONS`: `manage_ai_agents: { authorize_supervised_key: { resource: 'ai_agents', action: 'write' } }` — match the exact per-action entry shape used by `manage_tickets` at `:523-553`. `ai_agents:write` already exists in the canonical registry (`packages/shared/src/constants/permissions.ts:139-146`), seed, migration and catalog, so there is **no six-list permission ceremony**.
6. `aiGuardrails.ts` `TOOL_RATE_LIMITS`: `manage_ai_agents: { limit: 5, windowSeconds: 3600 },`.
7. `aiGuardrails.ts` `buildApprovalDescription`: `case 'manage_ai_agents':` returning `Authorize the AI agent to run "<opKey>" without an approval for this organization in future runs` — the op key only, never model text.
8. `aiGuardrails.ts` `checkAgentGuardrails` (line 1592): immediately after the `isSecretBearingTool` deny at `:1623-1625`, add `if (toolName === 'manage_ai_agents') return deny('Tool "manage_ai_agents" is human-only and is never available to agents');`. Omitted ⇒ a device-bound agent could propose its own promotion.
9. `aiGuardrails.approvalScope.contract.test.ts`: because item 4 makes `manage_ai_agents` a whole-tool member with a real `action` enum, BOTH pinned arrays must gain `'manage_ai_agents'` — the `enumerated.sort()` assertion at `:176-178` and the "exposes both enum sources" list at `:185`.
10. `effectDigest.ts` `EFFECT_DIGEST_RESOLVERS`: a `'manage_ai_agents:authorize_supervised_key'` resolver whose material is `{ agentId, opKey, partnerCeilingHasKey: boolean, orgKeys: string[] /* sorted */ }` — resolved from the org's effective agent, so an operator editing supervised keys during the approval window makes the approved digest stale and the release fails `content_changed` instead of silently granting a different authority. Returns `TARGET_ABSENT` when no partner baseline exists for the org. Omitted ⇒ `effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts:144-160` fails (every four-eyes surface needs a resolver or a ≥40-character `DELIBERATELY_UNPINNED` entry — use the resolver, not the exemption).
11. `apps/web/src/components/ai-risk/tierConfig.ts`: a `TIER_DEFINITIONS` tier-3 tools entry `{ name: 'manage_ai_agents (authorize_supervised_key)', description: 'Grant an AI agent a pre-authorized action key', category: 'AI Governance' }` and an `RBAC_MAPPINGS` entry `manage_ai_agents: { authorize_supervised_key: 'ai_agents.write' }`. Its parity test is one-way so omission would not fail CI — add it anyway (the file's whole purpose is to mirror `aiGuardrails.ts`).
12. `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/ai.mdx`: add `manage_ai_agents` (authorize_supervised_key) to the Tier-3 row and a new four-eyes bullet "AI agent governance — granting an agent a pre-authorized action key". `aiGuardrailsAiDocs.parity.test.ts` requires every documented `tool` (action) pair to be machine-parseable and to resolve to the tier the docs claim.
13. Keep `manage_ai_agents` **OUT** of `POLICY_DECIDABLE_TIER3` (`policyDecidable.ts:83` — its header at `:19-21` already excludes everything four_eyes: policy is a mechanism, not a second human) and out of `TIER3_ACTIONS` (unnecessary once the registered base tier is 3).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write `aiToolsAiAgentGovernance.test.ts` FIRST: `registerAiAgentGovernanceTools` puts `manage_ai_agents` in the map with `tier: 3`; `validateToolInput('manage_ai_agents', { action: 'authorize_supervised_key', kind: 'triage', opKey: 'manage_services:restart' })` succeeds and an unknown action fails; `checkGuardrails('manage_ai_agents', { action: 'authorize_supervised_key' })` returns `tier: 3` and `approvalScope: 'four_eyes'`; `checkAgentGuardrails('manage_ai_agents', …, <valid agent policy>)` returns `allowed: false, disposition: 'deny'` with a reason naming human-only; `isPolicyDecidableKey('manage_ai_agents:authorize_supervised_key') === false`; the effect-digest resolver returns a `material` whose bytes change when `orgKeys` changes and are stable when unrelated agent fields change.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiToolsAiAgentGovernance.test.ts` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement items 1-13. The tool handler at this point can `throw new Error('not implemented')` **only if** no test exercises it — Task 15 supplies the body in the same PR; prefer implementing 14 and 15 back to back and committing once if that is cleaner.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiToolsAiAgentGovernance src/services/aiToolsRegistryParity.test.ts src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.mcpCoverage.test.ts src/services/aiGuardrails.approvalScope.contract.test.ts src/services/actionIntents/effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts src/services/actionIntents/policyDecidable.test.ts src/services/aiGuardrailsTierConfig.parity.test.ts src/services/aiGuardrailsAiDocs.parity.test.ts src/services/aiAgents/verdictProfile.contract.test.ts` — ALL PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src apps/web/src/components/ai-risk/tierConfig.ts apps/docs && git commit -m "feat(api): manage_ai_agents:authorize_supervised_key — tier-3 four-eyes, human-only (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 15 (A2-5): Promote executor + creation route

**Files:** Create `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/supervisedKeyGrant.ts`, `supervisedKeyGrant.test.ts`; modify `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsAiAgentGovernance.ts` (the handler body), `apps/api/src/routes/aiAgents.ts` (mount `POST /ai/agents/graduation/promote` beside the existing `GET /policy-decidable-keys` at line 251).

**Interfaces (produced):**
```ts
export class SupervisedKeyGrantError extends Error {
  constructor(public readonly code:
    | 'policy_decide_disabled' | 'not_eligible' | 'needs_partner_baseline'
    | 'agent_not_found' | 'already_granted' | 'non_human_origin', message: string);
}

/** The promote executor. Runs inside the release path's org-scoped context,
 *  opens ONE system transaction, and under withGraduationLock:
 *   1. re-read BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED live (throw
 *      'policy_decide_disabled' — a flag flipped off mid-approval must not grant);
 *   2. assert the intent's origin is human (`intent.requestingAgentRunId` is
 *      null) else 'non_human_origin';
 *   3. re-evaluate eligibility (evaluateGraduation) and the partner ceiling —
 *      approval time is not execution time;
 *   4. SELECT the PARTNER baseline row FOR UPDATE, then the ORG row FOR UPDATE;
 *      when no org row exists, INSERT … ON CONFLICT (org_id, kind) WHERE
 *      disabled_at IS NULL DO NOTHING a clone of the EFFECTIVE policy (same
 *      mode/allowlists/limits/recipients as currently effective — a row built
 *      from schema defaults would disable the agent and empty its allowlists),
 *      then lock and re-read the winner;
 *   5. append opKey idempotently to the org row's actAssets.supervisedActionKeys
 *      (via withAgentRowLocked, Task 8);
 *   6. audit; graduation row -> 'promoted' with promoted_at + promoted_intent_id.
 */
export async function authorizeSupervisedKey(input: {
  orgId: string; kind: AiAgentKind; opKey: string; intentId: string; actorUserId: string;
}): Promise<{ agentId: string; orgAgentId: string; keys: string[] }>;
```
- The tool handler calls `authorizeSupervisedKey` with `orgId` taken from the executing auth context's org (the intent's `org_id`, pinned by the release path) — **never** from arguments. It catches `SupervisedKeyGrantError` and returns `JSON.stringify({ error: err.code, message: err.message })`: `isReturnedToolError` (`intentReleaseWorker.ts:148-162`) treats a parsed object with an `error` key and no `success`/`data`/`configured` key as a FAILED release, so the intent terminalizes `failed:tool_returned_error` instead of reading as a false success. Do not use `googleHelpers.errorString` — that helper belongs to the Google/M365 tool families.
- Route `POST /ai/agents/graduation/promote` (`scopes`, `requireAiWrite`): body `promoteSupervisedKeyRequestSchema`; 409 `{ error: 'policy_decide_disabled' }` when the flag is off; otherwise creates the four-eyes intent through the normal `createActionIntent` path with `tool: 'manage_ai_agents'`, `action: 'authorize_supervised_key'`, arguments `{ action, kind, opKey }`, and returns `{ intentId }`. Four-eyes as built = requester + one DIFFERENT approver, first eligible approval wins (`decideApprovalRequest.ts:964-1009`); the sole-operator WebAuthn self-approval exception (`intentService.ts:574-586`) applies unchanged — say so in the route's docstring.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: flag off ⇒ `policy_decide_disabled` and no write; an agent-originated intent ⇒ `non_human_origin`; a key that became ineligible between approval and release ⇒ `not_eligible` and no write; partner ceiling lost ⇒ `needs_partner_baseline`; no org row ⇒ a clone is inserted carrying the EFFECTIVE mode/toolAllowlist/limits (assert each field, non-uniform fixture) and then the key; an existing org row ⇒ append only, no clone; a duplicate key ⇒ idempotent, one entry; two concurrent calls ⇒ the advisory lock serializes them and the final array has one entry (assert `pg_advisory_xact_lock` in the compiled SQL and the ordering of the two FOR UPDATE selects: partner first, org second); the graduation row ends `promoted` with `promoted_intent_id` set. Route tests: 409 with the flag off; 201 with `{ intentId }`; RBAC denies without `ai_agents:write`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/supervisedKeyGrant.test.ts src/routes/aiAgents.test.ts` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/supervisedKeyGrant src/services/aiToolsAiAgentGovernance src/routes/aiAgents` — PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 promote executor — clone-from-effective, locked org-row grant (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 16 (A2-6): Auto-demote

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/supervisedKeyGrant.ts` (add the revoke half), `apps/api/src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts` (the attempted-failure evidence path from Task 4), `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/fixWatch.ts` (the `recurred` CAS from Task 6), and their tests.

**Interfaces (produced):**
```ts
/** Removes `opKey` from the ORG row's supervisedActionKeys, in the SAME
 *  transaction as the negative evidence insert and under the same
 *  withGraduationLock. Never touches `enabled`, `mode`, or the partner row. A
 *  key held only by the partner ceiling (no org grant) has nothing to revoke:
 *  returns { revoked: false } and records nothing. Notification is the caller's
 *  job, AFTER commit. */
export async function demoteSupervisedKey(input: {
  orgId: string; agentId: string; opKey: string;
  reason: 'attempted_failure' | 'recurrence';
  runId: string | null; watchId: string | null; intentId: string | null;
}): Promise<{ revoked: boolean; orgAgentId: string | null }>;

/** Post-commit notification, modelled exactly on sendRecurrenceNotifications
 *  (fixWatch.ts:292-336): recipients resolved from the RUN's immutable snapshot,
 *  priority 'high', dedupeKey `graduation-demote-<orgAgentId>-<opKey>-<runId ?? watchId>`,
 *  title/message naming the agent and the op key only. */
export async function notifyDemotion(input: {
  orgId: string; agentId: string; orgAgentId: string; opKey: string;
  reason: 'attempted_failure' | 'recurrence'; runId: string | null; watchId: string | null;
}): Promise<void>;
```
**Triggers (C9):** (a) an ATTEMPTED `failed` evidence row in namespace `policy_key` (the release worker's three attempted-failure branches from Task 4's table); (b) a watch `recurred` whose `op_keys` contains a colon key. In both cases, for each such colon key present in the ORG row's `supervisedActionKeys`: inside the evidence transaction, under `withGraduationLock`, `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` the org row, remove the key, write an audit entry `{ reason, runId, watchId, intentId, opKey }`, set the graduation row to `demoted` with `demote_reason`/`demote_run_id`/`demote_watch_id`/`demoted_at`. Notify only after the transaction commits. Auto-demote is **always on** — it does not consult `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED`.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: an attempted failure on a granted key removes it and stamps `demoted`; the SAME failure on a key held only by the partner ceiling revokes nothing and writes no graduation row change; a `recurred` watch with two op keys, one granted and one not, revokes exactly one; `enabled`/`mode`/the partner row are untouched (assert the compiled UPDATE's SET clause names only `act_assets` and `updated_at`); the notification fires only after commit and its message contains no model-authored text; a lost CAS on the watch writes nothing at all.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/supervisedKeyGrant src/services/aiAgents/fixWatch src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run the same command — PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 auto-demote on attempted failure or recurrence (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 17 (A2-7): Org merge must not carry graduated authority

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/orgMergeCustomExecutors.ts` (`mergeAiAgents`, lines 636-676) and `orgMergeCustomExecutors.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** none new. `mergeAiAgents` gains a THIRD statement, between the collision-disable UPDATE and `buildRepoint('ai_agents', loser, survivor)`:
```sql
UPDATE ai_agents
   SET act_assets = jsonb_set(coalesce(act_assets, '{}'::jsonb), '{supervisedActionKeys}', '[]'::jsonb),
       updated_at = now()
 WHERE org_id = <loser>
   AND disabled_at IS NULL
   AND jsonb_array_length(coalesce(act_assets -> 'supervisedActionKeys', '[]'::jsonb)) > 0
```
Its row count feeds a merge note: `ai_agents: cleared graduated supervised action keys on N agent(s) from the merged-away org — a survivor org must re-earn them (evidence is leave-for-erasure)`. Rationale comment: the repoint would otherwise hand the survivor an authority nobody granted it, while the evidence that justified it stays on the loser shell.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: a loser org agent with two supervised keys is repointed with an EMPTY key array and the note reports 1; an agent with no keys produces no note; the disable-collision behaviour is unchanged; the partner-wide rows (`org_id IS NULL`) are never touched (assert the `org_id = loser` predicate is present in the compiled SQL).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/orgMergeCustomExecutors` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/orgMergeCustomExecutors src/services/orgMergeRegistry` — PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/services/orgMergeCustomExecutors.ts apps/api/src/services/orgMergeCustomExecutors.test.ts && git commit -m "fix(api): org merge strips graduated supervised keys before repointing agents (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 18 (A2-8): Read route + DTO

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/routes/aiAgents.ts` (add `GET /graduation` beside `GET /policy-decidable-keys` at line 251), `apps/api/src/routes/aiAgents.test.ts`; the DTO types already exist from Task 1.

**Interfaces (consumed):** `AiAgentGraduationDto`, `AiAgentGraduationByOrgDto`, `loadGraduationRows`, `loadActOpReliability`, `resolveEffectiveAgentSystem`.

**Route contract:** `GET /ai/agents/graduation?orgId=<uuid>&kind=<AiAgentKind>` (`scopes`, `requireAiRead`).
- With `orgId`: resolve the effective agent SERVER-SIDE via `resolveEffectiveAgentSystem(orgId, kind)` — an org token carries a `partnerId` but never passes `breeze_has_partner_access`, so it cannot read the partner baseline row itself (`agentService.ts:341-350`); never trust an agent id from the query. Returns `AiAgentGraduationDto` with `ownerScope` = `'organization'` when an org override row exists, else `'partner'`.
- Partner scope with NO `orgId`: returns `AiAgentGraduationByOrgDto` — the same rows grouped per org, for the partner-wide agent page. Org-scope callers omitting `orgId` get 400.
- `policyDecideEnabled` mirrors the live env flag; `promoteThreshold` is the effective merged limit. The route WORKS with the flag off (read-only value without a flag flip) — only the promote POST 409s.
- Every row's `state`/`blockedReason` comes from `refreshGraduationRow` so a read is never staler than the request.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing route tests: org-scope call returns `version: 1` with rows and `actOpReliability`; the agent id in the response is the resolver's, not one supplied in the query (pass a bogus `agentId` param and assert it is ignored); a partner-scope call with no `orgId` returns `byOrg`; an org-scope call with no `orgId` is 400; the flag off still returns 200 with `policyDecideEnabled: false`; RBAC denies without `ai:read`; a cross-org `orgId` is denied by the scope middleware.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/aiAgents` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/aiAgents src/services/aiAgents/graduationService` — PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/routes packages/shared && git commit -m "feat(api): P2-5 graduation read route + versioned DTO (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 19 (A2-9): End-to-end live-Postgres proof

**Files:** Create `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/aiAgentGraduation.integration.test.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write the suite as ONE ordered narrative against a real DB: seed a partner baseline agent holding `manage_services:restart` in `supervisedActionKeys` and an org with NO agent override → assert `resolveEffectiveAgent` returns `supervisedActionKeys: []` (the ceiling, C3) → insert `promoteThreshold` `verified` evidence rows dated ≥ 14 days back through the real writers (release a real intent, then reach `held_qualified` on its watch) → `refreshGraduationRow` reports `eligible` → `POST /ai/agents/graduation/promote` creates a four-eyes intent → approve it as a DIFFERENT user (first eligible approval wins) → the release executes `authorizeSupervisedKey` → an org agent row now exists, cloned from the effective policy, holding the key, and `ai_agent_graduation` is `promoted` with `promoted_intent_id` → `resolveEffectiveAgent` now returns the key (so `attemptPolicyDecision` would see it) → release a second intent for the same key that fails with `execution_error` → the `failed` evidence row, the org-row key removal, and the `demoted` graduation row all committed together, the partner row untouched, and one high-priority notification queued → `refreshGraduationRow` reports `tracking` with a window that ignores everything at or before `demoted_at`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** `docker compose -p breeze-test-ai-agents-p2-5 -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d postgres`, then `cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/aiAgentGraduation.integration.test.ts` — expect FAIL first, then PASS.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Re-run the five registry contract suites listed in Task 10 Step 3 plus `aiAgentOpEvidence.integration.test.ts` — ALL PASS.
- [ ] **Step 4:** `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`; `pnpm lint` in `apps/api`, `packages/shared`, `apps/web` (tierConfig.ts changed), `apps/docs`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/api/src/__tests__ && git commit -m "test(api): P2-5 end-to-end graduation proof — ceiling, promote, policy-decide, demote (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`; run **Final verification**; open **PR A2** targeting main with body `Part of #4192`. STOP at the open PR.

---

## PR B — web (branch `feature/4187-ai-agents-p2/wave-4192-b`, base main, opened after A2 merges)

**PR B also carries P2-6b.** Wave P2-6 (#4193) shipped `AiAgentImpactDto.promoteEligibleCount` as a hard-coded `null` "until P2-5 lands" (`2026-09-01-ai-agents-p2-6-impact.md:72`, amendment 8). A2 has landed the graduation table and service, so Task 22 fills the field from `ai_agent_graduation` and puts the promotion-eligible tile on the impact page — the API half of PR B, and the only task in this PR that touches `apps/api`.

### Task 20 (B1): Graduation panel + partner ceiling hint

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/settings/AiAgentGraduationPanel.tsx`, `AiAgentGraduationPanel.test.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/settings/AiAgentForm.tsx` (render the panel below the `ai-agent-policy-decide` fieldset at lines 679-717; add the ceiling hint inside that fieldset), `apps/web/src/locales/{de-DE,en,es-419,fr-CA,fr-FR,it-IT,pt-BR,tr-TR}/settings.json`

**Interfaces (consumed):** `AiAgentGraduationDto`, `AiAgentGraduationByOrgDto`, `AiAgentGraduationRowDto`, `AiAgentActOpReliabilityDto` from `@breeze/shared`; `fetchWithAuth`; `runAction` + `ActionError` from `apps/web/src/lib/runAction.ts`.

- Panel props: `{ orgId: string | null; kind: AiAgentKind; isPartnerScope: boolean }`. Fetches `GET /ai/agents/graduation?orgId=…&kind=…` in a `useEffect` with `fetchWithAuth` (the file's existing pattern, `AiAgentForm.tsx:300`); partner scope with no `orgId` renders the `byOrg` grouping, and must surface `byOrgTruncated` (a partner over the 400-org cap sees only the first 400 by name — a silently short list reads as "these orgs have no evidence").
- Renders two tables: **Graduation** (op key, state badge, `verified / promoteThreshold`, failed, recurred, first verified, blocked reason) and **Act-op reliability** (op key, executed, verified, failed, recurred — read-only, dot keys are never promotable, say so in the caption).
- A **Promote** button appears only on rows with `state === 'eligible'` AND `policyDecideEnabled === true`. It opens a confirm dialog, then `runAction({ request: () => fetchWithAuth('/ai/agents/graduation/promote', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ orgId, kind, opKey }) }), successMessage: …, errorFallback: …, friendly: …, onUnauthorized: … })` and the success toast links to `/approvals`. Copy states plainly that approval affects **future runs only**.
- With `policyDecideEnabled === false` the whole panel is read-only with an explanatory note ("Pre-authorized execution is turned off for this deployment; these figures are informational") — the panel is the visible value that needs no flag flip.
- Ceiling hint inside the existing policy-decide fieldset, shown on the PARTNER form: "Partner-level keys are a ceiling, not a grant. Each organization's agent must be granted the key separately — through graduation or by editing that org's agent."
- `data-testid`s follow the file's kebab convention: `ai-agent-graduation-panel`, `ai-agent-graduation-row-<opKey>`, `ai-agent-graduation-promote-<opKey>`, `ai-agent-act-reliability-row-<opKey>`, `ai-agent-graduation-readonly-note`, `ai-agent-supervised-keys-ceiling-hint`.
- All copy through `t('aiAgentsPage.graduation.*')` in the `settings` namespace, in **all 8 locales**. Never compare UI logic against `i18n.t(...)` output in a test (the tr-TR rule).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing component tests: rows render from a mocked DTO with DISTINCT values per column (non-uniform fixture, so a wrong-column bug surfaces); the Promote button is absent for `tracking`/`promoted`/`demoted` rows and absent for an `eligible` row when `policyDecideEnabled` is false; clicking it POSTs the exact body and shows the toast; a 409 shows the friendly message and does not remove the row; `blockedReason` renders its own localized string per value (five cases); the read-only note appears exactly when the flag is off; the partner form shows the ceiling hint and the org form does not.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/settings/AiAgentGraduationPanel.test.tsx` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement the panel, the `AiAgentForm.tsx` wiring, and the 8 locale files.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/settings src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts` — PASS (add `--pool=threads --maxWorkers=2` if a dev stack is up; `AiAgentForm.tsx` is already in the no-silent-mutations target list at line 64, so any new mutating fetch must be `runAction`-wrapped). Then `cd apps/web && npx astro check`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/web && git commit -m "feat(web): P2-5 graduation panel, act-op reliability, partner ceiling hint, 8 locales (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### Task 21 (B2): "Approve and always allow" on the approvals inbox

**Files:** Modify `apps/web/src/components/approvals/ApprovalsInbox.tsx` (the card action group at lines 626-652; the `PendingApproval` type at lines 42-71 gains nothing — the eligibility comes from a separate fetch), `ApprovalsInbox.test.tsx`, `apps/web/src/locales/*/approvals.json` (8 files).

**Interfaces (consumed):** `AiAgentGraduationDto`; `decideIntentApproval` from `@/lib/intentApprovals`; `runAction`.

- On mount, for each DISTINCT `(orgId, actionToolName)` among supervised agent-originated cards, fetch `GET /ai/agents/graduation?orgId=…&kind=…` once and build a `Set<opKey>` of `state === 'eligible'` rows. Cache per orgId for the component's lifetime; a fetch failure disables the affordance silently (it is additive — never block the existing Approve).
- A **secondary** button "Approve and always allow" renders next to Approve only when: the card's `approvalScope === 'supervised'`, its `${actionToolName}:${action}` is in that org's eligible set, and the graduation DTO reported `policyDecideEnabled: true`. `data-testid={\`approval-always-allow-${approval.id}\`}`.
- Clicking it: first the normal `decideIntentApproval(approval.id, 'approve')` (the card's own intent is approved the ordinary way — graduation never retro-authorizes it), then `runAction` POSTing `/ai/agents/graduation/promote`. The confirm copy must say the promote applies to **future runs only** and needs a second approver. If the promote POST fails, the approve has already succeeded — surface that explicitly in the error toast rather than implying the whole action failed.
- Four-eyes cards are excluded structurally: they are never `approvalScope === 'supervised'` (the existing `isGroupable` comment at `ApprovalsInbox.tsx:95-118` documents this) — assert it in a test rather than adding a second condition.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write failing tests: the button renders only for a supervised card whose key is eligible; it is absent for a four-eyes/`critical` card, for an ineligible key, and when `policyDecideEnabled` is false; clicking calls `decideIntentApproval` FIRST and then the promote POST (assert call order); a failing promote after a successful approve produces the "approved, promotion failed" toast and the card still leaves the list; a graduation fetch failure hides the button and logs nothing user-facing.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/approvals/ApprovalsInbox.test.tsx` — expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement + the 8 `approvals.json` locale files.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/approvals src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts` — PASS; `cd apps/web && npx astro check`; `pnpm lint` in `apps/web`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit: `git add apps/web && git commit -m "feat(web): P2-5 approve-and-always-allow on eligible supervised agent cards (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`. Do NOT open the PR here — Task 22 is the last task in PR B and carries the Final-verification-then-open step.

### Task 22 (B3): P2-6b — `promoteEligibleCount` in the impact DTO + tile

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.ts` (append `countEligibleGraduations` after `loadActOpReliability`, which ends at `:673` = EOF; new type-only import beside the `drizzle-orm` import at `:31`), `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.test.ts` (the `../../db` capture mock is `:60-118`, the SUT import list `:121-130`, `sqlText`/`sqlParams` `:133-139`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/impactQuery.ts` (imports `:29-50`; the `Promise.all` at `:190-223`; the assembled return at `:275-290`, whose placeholder `promoteEligibleCount: null` is `:285-287`), `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/impactQuery.test.ts` (module mocks `:31-42`, `beforeEach` `:152-161`, and the case **`'schemaVersion is 1 and promoteEligibleCount is null'` at `:185-190`, which this task REWRITES**)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/aiAgents.test.ts` (`minimalImpactDto` fixture `:281-298`; its `promoteEligibleCount: null` is `:293`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/aiAgentImpact.integration.test.ts` (schema barrel import `:71-85`; `orgDbContext` `:185-194`; `orgAuth` `:195-208`; `Tenant`/`createTenant` `:210-232`; append the new `describe` after the final block, which ends at `:1226` = EOF)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/aiAgents/ImpactPage.tsx` (`Tile` `:208-226`; the tile grid `<div>` opens at `:519`, its last tile is `:557-561`, the grid closes at `:563`), `apps/web/src/components/aiAgents/ImpactPage.test.tsx` (the `dto()` fixture `:81-152`; its `promoteEligibleCount: null` is `:137`)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/{de-DE,en,es-419,fr-CA,fr-FR,it-IT,pt-BR,tr-TR}/settings.json` — two new leaves under `aiAgentsPage.impact.tiles` (the object holding `alertsJudged` … `llmSpend`), inserted after `fixesExecuted`
- Modify (**doc comment only**): `packages/shared/src/types/aiAgentImpact.ts:152` — the `/** P2-6b, after P2-5's ai_agent_graduation lands. Always null in P2-6. */` comment becomes the v1 contract below. The TYPE at `:153` (`promoteEligibleCount: number | null`) and `AI_AGENT_IMPACT_DTO_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` (`:111`) are **unchanged** — P2-6 shipped the field deliberately so filling it is additive (P2-6 plan amendment 8, `2026-09-01-ai-agents-p2-6-impact.md:72`), and a bump would invalidate every stored/exported DTO for a field whose type did not move.

**Interfaces (produced):**

```ts
// apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.ts
export async function countEligibleGraduations(
  orgCondition: (orgIdColumn: PgColumn) => SQL | undefined,
  orgId?: string,
): Promise<number>;
```

**Interfaces (consumed):**
- `aiAgentGraduation` — `apps/api/src/db/schema/aiAgentGraduation.ts:24`; columns `orgId` (`:28`), `agentId` (`:29`), `opKey` (`:30`), `state` (`:31`, `.$type<AiAgentGraduationState>()`, default `'tracking'`); unique `ai_agent_graduation_key_uq` on `(org_id, agent_id, op_key)` (`:58`). Re-exported by the barrel at `apps/api/src/db/schema/index.ts:60`.
- `AuthContext['orgCondition']: (orgIdColumn: PgColumn) => SQL | undefined` — declared `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts:125`, built by `buildOrgAccessClosures(accessibleOrgIds)` (`:256-282`): `null` → `undefined` (system scope, no filter); `[]` → the impossible `eq(col, '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')`; one id → `eq`; many → `inArray`.
- `db` from `../../db` — already imported by `graduationService.ts:44-49` and `impactQuery.ts:43`.
- `and`, `eq`, `sql`, `type SQL` from `drizzle-orm` — already imported by `graduationService.ts:31`. **New:** `import type { PgColumn } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';` (type-only, erased at build, so it adds nothing to the BullMQ worker closure `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` polices).
- `AiAgentImpactDto.promoteEligibleCount` — `packages/shared/src/types/aiAgentImpact.ts:153`.
- Web: `formatNumber` (already imported by `ImpactPage.tsx`), `useTranslation('settings')` (`ImpactPage.tsx:242`), and the `Tile` local component (`:208`).

**Contract:**

1. **What the number is.** `COUNT(*)` over `ai_agent_graduation` rows whose PERSISTED `state = 'eligible'`, within the caller's scope. One row is one `(org, agent, op_key)` tuple (the table's unique key), so the count is "operations ready to be promoted", not runs or evidence rows.
2. **Eligibility is never re-implemented.** `impactQuery.ts` gains exactly one new import — `countEligibleGraduations` from `./graduationService` — and never imports `evaluateEligibility`, `isPolicyDecidableKey`, `aiAgentOpEvidence`, or the window SQL. The `state` column it counts is written only by `refreshGraduationRow` (`graduationService.ts:494-533`, the sole writer of `tracking`/`eligible`), Task 15's promote executor (`promoted`) and Task 16's demote path (`demoted`).
3. **Scope, mapped to the three cases the impact query already implements** (`impactQuery.ts:157-175`): **org scope** → `orgCondition` collapses to `eq(org_id, thatOrg)`; **partner scope** → the same `inArray(accessibleOrgIds)` set the impact aggregate uses, so the tile and the byOrg table can never disagree about which orgs are in view; **system scope with `orgId`** → `orgCondition` is `undefined` and the explicit `eq(org_id, input.orgId)` narrows it. That third case is the whole reason `orgId` is a separate parameter rather than being folded into the closure. System scope WITHOUT `orgId` never reaches the count — `loadImpactSummary` throws at `:159-163` first.
4. **DB context.** The count runs under the CALLER's request context, exactly like every other statement in `impactQuery.ts`. `ai_agent_graduation` is Shape 1 (`org_id NOT NULL` + `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)`, auto-discovered by `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` — Global Constraints), so RLS scopes it already; `orgCondition` is the second, explicit gate for the reason `impactQuery.ts:7-10` gives — partner scope means ACCESSIBLE orgs, not every org under the partner. This is therefore the **one** function in `graduationService.ts` that deliberately does NOT go through `inSystemDbContext` (`:156-159`): every other function there reads the PARTNER baseline agent row, invisible to an org token, so they must elevate; this one touches only `ai_agent_graduation`, and elevating would DROP the RLS gate that makes an org-token count safe. Pin that reasoning in the function's docstring, and pin it in a test (Step 1) — a later "consistency" refactor that wraps it in `inSystemDbContext` is the exact regression this note exists to stop.
5. **Null, precisely.** The field stays `number | null` and in v1 the API **never returns null**. `ai_agent_graduation` ships unconditionally in A1's migration, and `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED` gates the promote WRITE, never this read — the rule `graduationService.ts:20-22` already states. `null` survives in the TYPE only so an older API behind a newer web build still renders (the web hides the tile). Because the type does not move, `schemaVersion` stays `1`.
6. **Staleness is bounded and named.** The persisted `state` is refreshed by the daily job (Task 13: `listTrackedTuples` → `refreshGraduationRow`) and by every graduation READ (Task 18). So the tile can lead the panel by at most one daily pass, and only in the "still says eligible" direction. The tile is a NUDGE that LINKS to the panel, where `loadGraduationRows` (`:583-641`) re-derives every state per request; it carries no promote action of its own.
7. **Link target.** `/settings/ai-agents` — `apps/web/src/pages/settings/ai-agents.astro` renders `AiAgentsPage`, which renders `AiAgentForm`, which is where Task 20 mounts `AiAgentGraduationPanel`. Task 20 introduces no new route and `AiAgentsPage` holds no hash state (verified: no `useHashState` / `location.hash` in `AiAgentsPage.tsx`), so there is no deeper anchor to link to.
8. **Leak rule.** The tile is a single integer. No op key, agent name, org name, or evidence row crosses from the ledger into the impact DTO.
9. **Out of scope, deliberately:** the PDF export (`buildImpactPdfRows`, `ImpactPage.tsx:165-206`). The PDF is a point-in-time impact report; a promotion backlog is a live to-do, not a period result, and adding it would need two more locale leaves per locale for no reporting value.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write the failing API unit tests.

  In `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.test.ts`, add `countEligibleGraduations` to the SUT import list (`:121-130`), add `import { withSystemDbAccessContext } from '../../db';` beside it, and append:

  ```ts
  describe('countEligibleGraduations', () => {
    const orgCondition = (col: PgColumn): SQL | undefined => inArray(col, [ORG_ID, OTHER_ORG_ID]);

    it('counts only state = eligible, predicated on the caller org set', async () => {
      state.selectQueue.push([{ count: 3 }]);

      const total = await countEligibleGraduations(orgCondition);

      expect(total).toBe(3);
      const where = sqlText(state.selectWheres[0]);
      expect(where).toContain('"state" = ');
      expect(sqlParams(state.selectWheres[0])).toContain('eligible');
      // The org predicate is present and targets ai_agent_graduation.org_id,
      // not some other table's — compiled SQL, never mock-call identity.
      expect(where).toContain('"ai_agent_graduation"."org_id" in ');
      expect(sqlParams(state.selectWheres[0])).toEqual(
        expect.arrayContaining([ORG_ID, OTHER_ORG_ID, 'eligible']),
      );
      // Never the other three states.
      for (const s of ['tracking', 'promoted', 'demoted']) {
        expect(sqlParams(state.selectWheres[0])).not.toContain(s);
      }
    });

    it('adds an explicit org equality when orgId is given, even for a system caller whose orgCondition is undefined', async () => {
      state.selectQueue.push([{ count: 1 }]);

      await countEligibleGraduations(() => undefined, ORG_ID);

      const where = sqlText(state.selectWheres[0]);
      expect(where).toContain('"ai_agent_graduation"."org_id" = ');
      expect(sqlParams(state.selectWheres[0])).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining([ORG_ID, 'eligible']));
    });

    it('returns 0 for an empty result set', async () => {
      state.selectQueue.push([]);
      await expect(countEligibleGraduations(orgCondition)).resolves.toBe(0);
    });

    it('does NOT elevate to a system context — the caller RLS context is the gate', async () => {
      // Every other function in this module joins-or-opens a system context;
      // this one must not, or an org caller's RLS scoping is discarded.
      state.dbContext = { scope: 'organization' };
      state.selectQueue.push([{ count: 2 }]);

      await countEligibleGraduations(orgCondition);

      expect(vi.mocked(withSystemDbAccessContext)).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
  });
  ```

  Add `const OTHER_ORG_ID = '00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000e6';` beside the existing id constants (`:22-31`), and `import { inArray } from 'drizzle-orm';` / `import type { PgColumn } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';` to the test's imports.

  In `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/impactQuery.test.ts`, mock the new module beside the existing `./impactWeights` mock (`:35-42`) so the `db.select` stub sequence used by every other case in the file is untouched:

  ```ts
  const { countEligibleGraduationsMock } = vi.hoisted(() => ({ countEligibleGraduationsMock: vi.fn() }));
  vi.mock('./graduationService', () => ({ countEligibleGraduations: countEligibleGraduationsMock }));
  ```

  Add `countEligibleGraduationsMock.mockResolvedValue(0);` to `beforeEach` (`:152-161`), then REPLACE the `'schemaVersion is 1 and promoteEligibleCount is null'` case at `:185-190` with:

  ```ts
  it('schemaVersion stays 1 and promoteEligibleCount carries the graduation count', async () => {
    countEligibleGraduationsMock.mockResolvedValueOnce(4);
    stubOrgScopeQueries([], [{ up: 0, down: 0 }]);

    const result = await loadImpactSummary(orgAuth(), { window: 7 });

    expect(result.schemaVersion).toBe(1);
    expect(result.promoteEligibleCount).toBe(4);
  });

  it('promoteEligibleCount is 0, not null, when no key is eligible', async () => {
    countEligibleGraduationsMock.mockResolvedValueOnce(0);
    stubOrgScopeQueries([], [{ up: 0, down: 0 }]);

    const result = await loadImpactSummary(orgAuth(), { window: 7 });

    expect(result.promoteEligibleCount).toBe(0);
  });

  it('org scope passes the caller orgCondition and the requested orgId through', async () => {
    stubOrgScopeQueries([], [{ up: 0, down: 0 }]);
    const auth = orgAuth();

    await loadImpactSummary(auth, { window: 7, orgId: ORG_A });

    expect(countEligibleGraduationsMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    const [passedCondition, passedOrgId] = countEligibleGraduationsMock.mock.calls[0]!;
    expect(passedOrgId).toBe(ORG_A);
    // The SAME closure the impact aggregates use, proven by compiling what it
    // builds — not by identity, which a wrapper would satisfy vacuously.
    expect(compile(passedCondition(aiAgentGraduation.orgId)).params).toEqual([ORG_A]);
  });

  it('partner scope passes an orgCondition covering exactly the accessible orgs, and no orgId', async () => {
    stubPartnerScopeQueries([], [], [{ up: 0, down: 0 }]);

    await loadImpactSummary(partnerAuth(), { window: 30 });

    const [passedCondition, passedOrgId] = countEligibleGraduationsMock.mock.calls[0]!;
    expect(passedOrgId).toBeUndefined();
    expect(compile(passedCondition(aiAgentGraduation.orgId)).params).toEqual([ORG_A, ORG_B]);
  });
  ```

  That last pair needs `import { aiAgentGraduation } from '../../db/schema/aiAgentGraduation';` in the test (the direct module, not the barrel — the file already mocks `../../db`, and the barrel would drag unmocked schema modules in).

  Finally, in `apps/api/src/routes/aiAgents.test.ts`, change the `minimalImpactDto` fixture at `:293` from `promoteEligibleCount: null` to `promoteEligibleCount: 0` — a structurally-valid DTO must now carry the shape the service actually returns.

- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.test.ts src/services/aiAgents/impactQuery.test.ts` — expect FAIL: `countEligibleGraduations` is not exported (`TypeError: countEligibleGraduations is not a function`) and `promoteEligibleCount` is still the hard-coded `null`. Check the reported file count is 2 — a 0-test run is a stall, not green.

- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement the API side.

  Append to `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.ts` (after `loadActOpReliability`, `:642-673`), and add `import type { PgColumn } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';` beside the `drizzle-orm` import at `:31`:

  ```ts
  /**
   * How many `(org, agent, op_key)` tuples are sitting in `eligible` — the
   * P2-6b `promoteEligibleCount` on the impact DTO (`aiAgentImpact.ts:153`).
   *
   * Unlike every other export in this module it runs under the CALLER's
   * request DB context and does NOT go through `inSystemDbContext`. The others
   * read the PARTNER baseline agent row, which an org token cannot see, so
   * they must elevate. This one reads `ai_agent_graduation` only — Shape 1
   * (`org_id NOT NULL` + `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)`) — so the caller's own
   * RLS context is a real gate, and elevating would THROW IT AWAY. Do not
   * "harmonize" this with the rest of the file.
   *
   * `orgCondition` is `auth.orgCondition` (`middleware/auth.ts:125`), applied
   * on top of RLS for the reason `impactQuery.ts` states: partner scope means
   * ACCESSIBLE orgs, not every org under the partner. `orgId` narrows to one
   * org and is what makes a system-scope caller (whose `orgCondition` returns
   * `undefined`) still land on exactly the org it named.
   *
   * Reads the persisted `state`; it never re-derives eligibility. That column
   * is written by `refreshGraduationRow` above (the only writer of
   * `tracking`/`eligible`), by the promote executor (`promoted`) and by the
   * demote path (`demoted`), so this count can lag a window change by at most
   * one daily evaluation pass — the caller must present it as a link to the
   * graduation panel, which re-derives per read, not as an authoritative list.
   */
  export async function countEligibleGraduations(
    orgCondition: (orgIdColumn: PgColumn) => SQL | undefined,
    orgId?: string,
  ): Promise<number> {
    const rows = await db
      .select({ count: sql<number>`COUNT(*)::int` })
      .from(aiAgentGraduation)
      .where(and(
        orgCondition(aiAgentGraduation.orgId),
        orgId === undefined ? undefined : eq(aiAgentGraduation.orgId, orgId),
        eq(aiAgentGraduation.state, 'eligible'),
      ));
    return Number((rows as Array<{ count: number }>)[0]?.count ?? 0);
  }
  ```

  In `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/impactQuery.ts`, add the import beside the sibling service imports (`:49-50`):

  ```ts
  import { countEligibleGraduations } from './graduationService';
  ```

  Extend the `Promise.all` at `:190-223` with a fifth entry so the count is concurrent with the three aggregates rather than serialized after them:

  ```ts
  const [rawSeriesRows, rawByOrgRows, rawFeedbackRows, partnerId, promoteEligibleCount] = await Promise.all([
    // Entries 1-3 (the series select, the partner-scope byOrg select, the
    // feedback select) stay verbatim as written at `:191-221`.
    resolveImpactPartnerId(auth, input.orgId),
    // P2-6b (#4193 follow-up, P2-5 #4192 Task 22): the persisted `eligible`
    // count over the SAME accessible-org set the aggregates above use. Never
    // re-derives eligibility — `graduationService` owns that ladder.
    countEligibleGraduations(auth.orgCondition, input.orgId),
  ]);
  ```

  Replace the placeholder at `:285-287` with `promoteEligibleCount,` and update the field's doc comment at `packages/shared/src/types/aiAgentImpact.ts:152` to:

  ```ts
  /**
   * `(org, agent, op_key)` tuples in `ai_agent_graduation` state `eligible`
   * over the same accessible-org set as `totals` — "operations ready to be
   * promoted to pre-authorized execution". Refreshed by the daily graduation
   * pass and by every graduation read, so it may lag the graduation panel by
   * one pass; surface it as a LINK to that panel, never as a list.
   * `number | null` only so an older API behind a newer web build still
   * renders — v1 always returns a number.
   */

- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.test.ts src/services/aiAgents/impactQuery.test.ts src/routes/aiAgents.test.ts` — PASS (3 files). Then `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` and `cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

- [ ] **Step 5:** Extend the live-Postgres proof. In `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/aiAgentImpact.integration.test.ts`, add `aiAgentGraduation` to the schema barrel import (`:71-85`, alphabetically before `aiAgentImpactDaily`), and append after the final `describe` (`:1215-1226`):

  ```ts
  function partnerDbContext(partnerId: string, accessibleOrgIds: string[]): DbAccessContext {
    return { scope: 'partner', orgId: null, accessibleOrgIds, accessiblePartnerIds: [partnerId], userId: null };
  }

  function partnerAuth(partnerId: string, userId: string, accessibleOrgIds: string[]): AuthContext {

      canAccessOrg,
    } as unknown as AuthContext;
  }

  describe('promoteEligibleCount — live graduation rows in the impact DTO', () => {

  ```

  Run `docker compose -p breeze-test-ai-agents-p2-5 -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d postgres`, then `cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/aiAgentImpact.integration.test.ts` — expect FAIL on the new cases first if Step 3 were reverted, then PASS with the whole file green (the pre-existing cases must not regress: the DTO gained a value, not a statement, on the paths they cover).

- [ ] **Step 6:** Write the failing web tests. In `apps/web/src/components/aiAgents/ImpactPage.test.tsx`, change the `dto()` fixture at `:137` to `promoteEligibleCount: 5` (distinct from every other number in that fixture, so a tile wired to the wrong field fails), and append:

  ```ts
  describe('ImpactPage — promotion-eligible tile', () => {
    it('renders the count and links to the graduation panel', async () => {
      fetchMock.mockResolvedValueOnce(json({ data: dto() }));
      render(<ImpactPage />);

      const tile = await screen.findByTestId('ai-impact-tile-promote-eligible');
      expect(tile).toHaveTextContent('5');
      expect(tile.getAttribute('href')).toBe('/settings/ai-agents');
    });

    it('renders 0 as a tile, not as a hidden one', async () => {
      fetchMock.mockResolvedValueOnce(json({ data: dto({ promoteEligibleCount: 0 }) }));
      render(<ImpactPage />);

      expect(await screen.findByTestId('ai-impact-tile-promote-eligible')).toHaveTextContent('0');
    });

    it('hides the tile when the API returns null (an older API behind a newer build)', async () => {
      fetchMock.mockResolvedValueOnce(json({ data: dto({ promoteEligibleCount: null }) }));
      render(<ImpactPage />);

      await screen.findByTestId('ai-impact-tile-llm-cents');
      expect(screen.queryByTestId('ai-impact-tile-promote-eligible')).toBeNull();
    });
  });
  ```

  Run `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/aiAgents/ImpactPage.test.tsx` — expect FAIL (`Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="ai-impact-tile-promote-eligible"]`).

- [ ] **Step 7:** Implement the web side.

  Give `Tile` (`ImpactPage.tsx:208-226`) an optional `href` so the testid stays on the same element in both variants:

  ```tsx
  function Tile({
    testId,
    label,
    value,
    title,
    href,
  }: {
    testId: string;
    label: string;
    value: string;
    title?: string;
    href?: string;
  }) {
    const body = (
      <>
        <p className="text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-wide text-muted-foreground">{label}</p>
        <p className="mt-1 text-2xl font-semibold tabular-nums">{value}</p>
      </>
    );
    if (href) {
      return (
        <a
          data-testid={testId}
          href={href}
          title={title}
          className="block rounded-lg border bg-card p-4 transition-colors hover:bg-accent focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring"
        >
          {body}
        </a>
      );
    }
    return (
      <div data-testid={testId} title={title} className="rounded-lg border bg-card p-4">
        {body}
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  Widen the tile grid only when the eighth tile is present, so the row never leaves a hole (`:519`; both class literals appear in source, which Tailwind's JIT scanner requires):

  ```tsx
  <div
    className={`grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 lg:grid-cols-4 ${
      dto.promoteEligibleCount === null ? 'xl:grid-cols-7' : 'xl:grid-cols-8'
    }`}
  >
  ```

  Add the tile after the LLM-spend tile (`:557-561`), inside that grid:

  ```tsx
  {/* P2-6b: a nudge, not a list — the graduation panel re-derives state per
      read, so the exact rows live there and this only ever links to them. */}
  {dto.promoteEligibleCount !== null && (
    <Tile
      testId="ai-impact-tile-promote-eligible"
      label={t('aiAgentsPage.impact.tiles.promoteEligible')}
      value={formatNumber(dto.promoteEligibleCount)}
      title={t('aiAgentsPage.impact.tiles.promoteEligibleHint')}
      href="/settings/ai-agents"
    />
  )}
  ```

  Add the two leaves to `aiAgentsPage.impact.tiles` in all 8 catalogs, after `fixesExecuted`:

  | locale | `promoteEligible` | `promoteEligibleHint` |
  |---|---|---|
  | `en` | `Promotion-eligible operations` | `Operations with enough clean evidence to be pre-authorized. Open Settings → AI Agents to review and promote them.` |
  | `de-DE` | `Für Freigabe geeignete Vorgänge` | `Vorgänge mit ausreichend fehlerfreien Nachweisen für eine Vorabgenehmigung. Öffnen Sie Einstellungen → KI-Agenten, um sie zu prüfen und freizugeben.` |
  | `es-419` | `Operaciones aptas para promoción` | `Operaciones con evidencia suficiente y sin fallas para autorizarse previamente. Abre Configuración → Agentes de IA para revisarlas y promoverlas.` |
  | `fr-CA` | `Opérations admissibles à la promotion` | `Opérations disposant d'assez de preuves sans échec pour être préautorisées. Ouvrez Paramètres → Agents IA pour les examiner et les promouvoir.` |
  | `fr-FR` | `Opérations éligibles à la promotion` | `Opérations disposant de suffisamment de preuves sans échec pour être préautorisées. Ouvrez Paramètres → Agents IA pour les examiner et les promouvoir.` |
  | `it-IT` | `Operazioni idonee alla promozione` | `Operazioni con prove sufficienti e senza errori per essere preautorizzate. Apri Impostazioni → Agenti IA per esaminarle e promuoverle.` |
  | `pt-BR` | `Operações elegíveis para promoção` | `Operações com evidências suficientes e sem falhas para serem pré-autorizadas. Abra Configurações → Agentes de IA para revisar e promover.` |
  | `tr-TR` | `Yükseltmeye uygun işlemler` | `Ön yetkilendirme için yeterli ve hatasız kanıta sahip işlemler. İncelemek ve yükseltmek için Ayarlar → Yapay Zekâ Ajanları'nı açın.` |

  Every non-English value differs from the English one, so `translationCoverage.test.ts`'s per-namespace exact-duplicate baselines need no bump. Never compare UI logic against `i18n.t(...)` output in a test (the tr-TR rule).

- [ ] **Step 8:** Run `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/aiAgents/ImpactPage.test.tsx src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts` — PASS (3 files; add `--pool=threads --maxWorkers=2` if a dev stack is up). Then `cd apps/web && npx astro check` — clean. Then `pnpm lint` in `apps/web`, `apps/api` and `packages/shared`. `no-silent-mutations` is untouched by this task (the tile is a link, not a mutation), but it is already in PR B's Step 4 run above.

- [ ] **Step 9:** Commit: `git add apps/api apps/web packages/shared && git commit -m "feat(api,web): P2-6b — promoteEligibleCount in the impact DTO and a promotion-eligible tile (#4192)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>" -m "Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_01EDZToQ9YjbpojJorSx28M2"`; run **Final verification**; open **PR B** targeting main with body `Closes #4192` (and note it also closes out the P2-6b follow-up left by `2026-09-01-ai-agents-p2-6-impact.md`). STOP at the open PR.

## Final verification (before each PR opens)

- [ ] **Migration name re-check (PR A1 only, and again at merge time).** Run `git fetch origin main && git ls-tree --name-only origin/main apps/api/migrations | node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d).on('end',()=>console.log(s.trim().split('\n').sort((a,b)=>a.localeCompare(b)).slice(-3).join('\n')))"`. `2026-09-29-ai-agents-graduation-evidence.sql` **must sort after** the newest name printed. If W06 landed `2026-09-30-…` first, rename the file to sort after it (the file is unmerged, so renaming is safe) **and sweep every reference**: `grep -rn '2026-09-29-ai-agents-graduation-evidence' apps/api` — integration suites that replay migrations by path turn a missed rename into an `ENOENT` minutes into Integration Tests. Never use today's real date: shipped names run ahead of it.
- [ ] `pnpm lint` in every package the PR touched (`apps/api`, `packages/shared`, `apps/web`, `apps/docs`).
- [ ] `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`; `cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`; `cd apps/web && npx astro check`.
- [ ] Contract suites, against a live DB where required — ALL must pass, and all of them are Integration-Tests-only except the last four:
  `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts`, `tenantCascade.integration.test.ts`, `tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts`, `tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts`, `orgMergeRegistry.integration.test.ts`, and (unit, **Test API**) `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts`, `effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts`, `aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts`, `policyDecidable.test.ts`, `verdictProfile.contract.test.ts`.
- [ ] Mechanical registry grep (this is the check code review has caught 0/5 times and the contract tests 5/5): `grep -rn 'ai_agent_op_evidence\|ai_agent_graduation' apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts apps/api/src/services/orgMergeRegistry.ts` — six hits, two per file. And `grep -n 'op_keys\|intent_id\|source_kind' apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts` must show the three new fix-watch columns.
- [ ] `pnpm db:migrate` twice in a row on a fresh DB (idempotency), then `pnpm db:check-drift` clean.
- [ ] Confirm no forbidden profile literal crept in: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/verdictProfile.contract.test.ts`.
- [ ] PR body: A1 and A2 carry `Part of #4192`; B carries `Closes #4192`. Every body lists, explicitly, each scope call this plan made — the contract points implemented (C1–C16), the migration filename as merged, the registries touched, the contract suites run with their results, and any item from **Deviations from the contract** below that the PR relies on.
- [ ] **PR B only (Task 22 touches `apps/api`, `packages/shared` and `apps/web`).** Unit: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgents/graduationService.test.ts src/services/aiAgents/impactQuery.test.ts src/routes/aiAgents.test.ts` (3 files) and `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/settings src/components/approvals src/components/aiAgents/ImpactPage.test.tsx src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts`. Live DB: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/aiAgentImpact.integration.test.ts` — the WHOLE file green, not just the two new `promoteEligibleCount` cases. Types: `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`, `cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`, `cd apps/web && npx astro check`. Grep guard for the deferral this PR closes: `grep -rn 'promoteEligibleCount' apps packages` must show NO remaining `: null` producer in `services/aiAgents/impactQuery.ts` — only the `number | null` type in `packages/shared/src/types/aiAgentImpact.ts` and the web's null-guard.
- [ ] All three PRs target **main**, so `gh pr checks` is real. Do NOT stack them: a PR based on a sibling branch runs no CI at all and reads green.

## Deviations from the contract

Every item below was verified by reading the cited file in this worktree (which equals `origin/main`). Where the contract and the code disagree, the code wins and the plan follows the code.

1. **C4's terminal-branch classification is under-specified and one branch is missing.** The contract lists "generic pre-execution CAS failures (:237-245)" as a not-counted branch, but `intentReleaseWorker.ts:237-257` is `failIntent`'s *definition*, not a call site. The real inventory is the twelve exits tabulated in Task 4, and it includes a branch the contract omits: `failOnPlaintextSecretGuard` (`:284-294`) CASes to `failed` with `executed: true` after the tool has already run, so it IS an attempted failure. More usefully, the codebase already carries the exact discriminator the contract was reaching for: `failIntent`'s `executed?: boolean` option stamps `executed_at` "used for `execution_error` and `secret_seal_invariant_violated`, both of which mean a real attempt was made … the earlier revalidation stops never touched execution" (`:229-236`). The plan therefore defines attempted-ness as "the terminal write stamps `executedAt`" rather than as a hand-maintained line-number list.

2. **The canonical key resolver is not exported and cannot simply be exported.** C4 says to use "the resolver exported from `policyDecide.ts:67-74`". `canonicalPolicyKey` is module-private there (`policyDecide.ts:71`) with one caller (`:534`). Exporting it from `policyDecide.ts` would drag that module's graph (`attemptPolicyDecision`, the exposure ledger, the kill-state reader) into the release worker and the evidence writers. The plan moves it to a new leaf module `services/actionIntents/canonicalPolicyKey.ts` that imports only `resolveActionForTool` (`aiGuardrails.ts:1241`), and `policyDecide.ts` imports it back. One definition, no graph bloat, and `policyDecide.ts` stays clean for `verdictProfile.contract.test.ts`.

3. **`source_id` for watch evidence must include the op key.** C1 defines UNIQUE `(source_kind, source_id, metric)` and gives `source_id` = "watch id" for watches, while C5 requires one evidence row per entry of `op_keys` with the same metric. Those two are inconsistent: N keys would collide on one unique tuple and all but the first would be silently dropped by `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. The plan uses `source_id = '<watchId>:<opKey>'` (`watchEvidenceSourceId`).

4. **`source_id` for act executions is `<runId>:<index>`, not `<run_id>:<tool_use_id>`.** C1 proposes a `tool_use_id`, but `OutcomeExecutedAction` (`runLoop.ts:186-217`) carries no such field — it has `executionId`, which is documented to fall back to the literal `'(inline)'` when the execution-ledger write fails (`:189-198`), so it is not unique within a run. The plan writes act evidence in `finishRun` (after the terminal CAS is won, so at most once per run — `finishRun` returns early on `!moved`) using the action's index in `outcome.executedActions`, which is deterministic and unique.

5. **The agent-principal denial goes at `aiGuardrails.ts:1623-1626`, not `:1654-1710`.** `checkAgentGuardrails` starts at `:1592`; the correct insertion point is immediately after the `isSecretBearingTool` deny at `:1623-1625`, before the multiplexed-action resolution. The `:1654-1710` range is further down the same function.

6. **The approvalScope contract test needs TWO list edits at `:176-178` and `:185`, not one at `:177-191`.** Making `manage_ai_agents` a whole-tool `TIER3_FOUR_EYES_TOOLS` member (which C8 requires, and which is the safer fail-closed posture) puts it into `multiplexedBackstopTools()`, so both the `enumerated.sort()` array (`:176-178`) and the separate "exposes both enum sources" list (`:185`) must gain the name.

7. **`KNOWN_MISSING_TOOL_TIERS` does not live in `aiAgentSdkTools.ts`.** C8 says to keep the tool out of it; the set is actually in `aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts:43+` and may only shrink. Registering `TOOL_TIERS.manage_ai_agents = 3` is what keeps it out — no edit to that file at all.

8. **The `TOOL_TIERS` template is `manage_organizations`, not `manage_tickets`.** `manage_tickets` has a Zod schema and `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` entries but NO `TOOL_TIERS` entry and NO `tool()` declaration, so it is unreachable from chat/MCP today — the exact failure mode documented at `aiAgentSdkTools.ts:2256-2261`. Copying it would reproduce the bug.

9. **`effectDigest` needs a real resolver, and its material must be the authority set, not the evidence counts.** C8 says only "add a resolver". Pinning the eligibility counters would make the digest drift on every new evidence row and fail every promotion approval. The plan pins `{ agentId, opKey, partnerCeilingHasKey, orgKeys }` — which drifts exactly when someone edits supervised keys during the approval window, which is the TOCTOU the effect digest exists to catch.

10. **The intent-watch recovery sweep needs no `workerRegistry.ts` entry.** C5 asks for "a recovery sweep in `fixWatchWorker`". Adding a new registry entry would force edits to `EXPECTED_NAMES` and the hard-coded `expect(entries.length).toBe(115)` at `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts:453`. The plan instead widens `fixWatchQueueJobDataSchema` (`queueSchemas.ts:321-324`) with a `{ phase: 'recover' }` variant on the existing queue and job name; at a 2-minute interval it is also below `COARSE_REPEAT_INTERVAL_MS`, so `scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts` needs no slot either. The A1 retention worker DOES need one registry entry (and the `115 → 116` bump), and A2's daily evaluator reuses that same queue so the count bumps only once.

11. **`createFixWatchRow`'s conflict target must gain the index predicate.** C5 requires the `run_id` UNIQUE to become partial. `createFixWatchRow` currently uses `.onConflictDoNothing({ target: aiAgentFixWatches.runId })` (`fixWatch.ts:177`); Postgres cannot infer a partial unique index without its predicate. drizzle-orm 0.45.2's `onConflictDoNothing({ target, where })` renders `on conflict (col) where <pred> do nothing` (`insert.js:107`), which is exactly the form needed — verified in the installed package, not assumed.

12. **`recordVerdictFeedback` must keep its "a different user may never overwrite" rule.** C10 describes the rewrite as `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` + update + upsert, without mentioning the existing CAS predicate `feedback_by IS NULL OR feedback_by = <this user>` (`alertVerdicts.ts:612-615`) and its documented 404-vs-409 contract. The plan preserves both, moving the check inside the lock (which strictly improves it — the current follow-up SELECT is not atomic with the UPDATE).

13. **Line-number corrections (all minor, code unchanged):** `orgMergeCustomExecutors.mergeAiAgents` is `:636-676`, not `:637-675`. `updateAgent` is `:470-533`, not `:470-520`. `TIER3_FOUR_EYES_ACTIONS` is `:309-330`. `effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts`'s requirement is at `:144-160`. `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts`'s global-closure block is `:451-473`. `effectivePolicy.test.ts`'s pinned assertion is the `it(...)` beginning at `:367` with the assertion at `:372-374` — the contract's cite is correct.

14. **There is no policy-decide deploy runbook.** C3 asks for "a note in `docs/deploy` runbook for policy-decide". `docs/deploy/` contains no such file (`ai-kill-switch.md`, `agent-server-url-migration.md`, `agent-update-trust-bootstrap.md`, the two M365 executor docs); the only prose about the flag lives in the wave-5B plan and the spec. The plan puts the ceiling note in `docs/deploy/ai-kill-switch.md`, which already documents the policy-decide lane's kill behaviour, rather than creating a one-paragraph file.

15. **Unresolved / defaulted:** C1 does not say whether `run_id` carries a foreign key. The plan gives it a composite `(run_id, org_id) → ai_agent_runs(id, org_id) ON DELETE SET NULL` (the target `ai_agent_runs_id_org_uq` already exists, `aiAgents.ts:161`) — it makes a cross-tenant forged pointer a 23503 even under a system context, which is the tenancy invariant this repo holds everywhere else, and `SET NULL` keeps the evidence when a run is erased. If a reviewer prefers the `rule_id` treatment (a bare historical uuid with no FK), dropping the constraint is a one-line change with no other consequence.
